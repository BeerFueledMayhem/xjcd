<font face="Times New Roman" class="fsx05" color="#000000">A simple check of the float levels can be done on the bike, with the bike<br>
properly leveled on the centre stand, etc. Adjusting them is best done off<br>
the bike.<br>
<br>
In the event a drain is plugged, the carbs have to come off, the<br>
bowl removed, and the drain cleared, so it's probably best to check them off<br>
the bike afterwards.<br>
<br>
Having removed the carbs, make sure the drain screw will turn. You can<br>
gently clamp the rack in a wooden vice to hold things steady while you use a<br>
GOOD screwdriver to remove the screw. Heat may seem like a good idea until<br>
you realize the carb bowl is now full of gasoline vapour, so you'll have to<br>
rely on holding the screwdriver very straight, lean in real hard, and turn<br>
if it's stuck.<br>
<br>
Once all the screws are free, remove the bowl(s) (being careful not to lose<br>
the little pin holding the float in place -- it's kept from sliding out by<br>
the bowl) and soak with some carb cleaner overnight. Remove the drain screw<br>
completely and try spraying into the bowl from the drain screw side. This is<br>
just about the only passage in the carb where it is permissible to poke with<br>
a piece of wire. Once the obstruction is cleared, spray it out thoroughly,<br>
or even soak it again. Replace the bowl when you are satisfied.<br>
<br>
To check the float levels, you will need a piece of 1/4" clear plastic tube<br>
about a foot long, and another piece of 5/16" tube long enough to reach from<br>
your elevated fuel supply to the carb inlet. You will also need some means<br>
of holding the bank steady and level. I just use a B&D workmate, beside my<br>
workbench. The workmate is lower than my workbench, so I put the bike's gas<br>
tank on it, and gently clamp the carb bank across the mating faces of the<br>
carb air intakes and outlets. This leaves the bowls hanging free below the<br>
top of the workmate, so I can easily remove them during the adjustments.<br>
Putting a spirit level across the chrome diaphragm covers usually levels<br>
them nicely, but you can check with the tube, as shown in the manual. I also<br>
put a pan on the floor below the bank to catch any spilled fuel.<br>
<br>
Connect the tank to the bank with the 5/16" tubing, and turn the petcock to<br>
PRI to fill the bowls. Connect the 1/4" tube to the bowl drain, lift the<br>
hose high to the side of the bank, and open the drain screw. When the hose<br>
fills with fuel, slowly lower it alongside the bowl edge, and measure the<br>
level. NEVER lift the hose up -- you will not get an accurate reading!<br><br>

The float needle valve acts like a check valve -- it lets fuel into the bowl, <br>
but not back out. So, if you fill the clear plastic tube and lift it up to the <br>
side of the carb body, the excess fuel in the tube drains back into the bowl<br> 
raising the fuel level artificially, making it appear that the fuel level is <br>
higher than it really is. Conversely, lowering the hose causes fuel to flow <br>
into the hose, lowering the fuel level in the bowl until the float valve opens. <br>
At this point, the fuel level in the tube will not drop further and reflects <br>
the real level of the float setting. You can now stop lowering the hose and take <br>
the reading. Watch carefully: while it is normal for the level to bounce back up <br> 
slightly after lowering the hose, a steady rise in level that does not stop <br>
indicates a leaky needle valve that needs cleaning or replacement. <br><br>
 
Shut the fuel off, drain and remove the bowl, and adjust the float as required.<br>
(TINY adjustments here -- a slight bend makes a big difference) Re-install<br>
and check. Yes, the +/- 1mm is important.<br>
<br>
When you're happy, move on to the next carb, draining your 1/4" tube between<br>
each check to prevent an air lock and inaccurate readings.<br>
<br>
One last final note:<br>
<br>
I would give serious consideration to doing a complete cleaning of all the<br>
carbs while you have them off. You already have some kind of sediment<br>
problem plugging up the bowl drain. The odds are good that the carbs would<br>
benefit from a proper and complete cleaning.<br>
