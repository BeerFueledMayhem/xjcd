BOLTS & SCREWS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The job looked so easy ! Three, four bolts and that part will come right <br>
off...30 seconds to do it... Max. Two hours of frustrating work later, it's <br>
still in there...WHAT DO I DO NOW ! <br>
It's happened to all of us, at one time or the other. Those lousy phillips head <br>
screws seems to strip out so easy ! First, make sure the grooves in the screw <br>
head are in good condition. Also, make sure the phillips screw driver or impact <br>
bit is the right size. If the screw head is a bit messed up you can put some <br>
fine aluminum carbide paste, similer to valve grinding paste on it to help the <br>
tool hold to the screw. Penetrating oil won't hurt, but I usually only use it on <br>
nuts or on screws that I feel will be a problem. On most crankcase screws, the <br>
head is a long way from the threads.<br>
Soooo... you give that Impact Driver a good swat and the screw head strips <br>
completely out. OK, OK...go get a small, sharp flat steel chisel and a steel <br>
punch. Using either one or maybe both ! Gouge and punch into the screw head. Do <br>
this off center and in the right direction ( counter-clockwise ). If all goes <br>
well, the screw will loosen. If not, you will have to drill out the Screw. Pick <br>
a drill of about the same diameter as the SHAFT of the stuck screw, NOT the <br>
head. Now, get a drill and drill it out. Go in just far enough to break the head <br>
off the shaft. Do this with each screw head that is rounded out and remove the <br>
cover or whatever part the screw is holding on. Now you will see the shaft of <br>
the screw sticking out. Grasp it with a vicegrip plyer and unscrew it. About 80 <br>
% of the time it will come out very easily, sometimes with even with your <br>
fingers.<br>
OK, but what if it doesn't ? Ah yes, the other 20 %. There are several options, <br>
none of which are easy or fun. <br>
  Soak the shaft in some kind of penetrating oil for awhile, overnight maybe, <br>
  then try the Vice-Grip again. Don't go crazy with the Vice-Grip. You don't <br>
  want to twist it off, and rust can really lock things in. How tight can rust <br>
  lock something up ? Well, I had a friend who worked at a big shop that had a <br>
  20 Ton press with a guage on it giving the pressure. He tried to press an axle <br>
  out of a Troy-Built rototiller wheel. He gave it the full 20 Tons... It never <br>
  did come out ! The only thing holding it to the wheel was rust. I have had <br>
  similar things happen to me. How did he get it off ? Cut it off with a torch <br>
  and replaced the wheel and axle. Hey, he's not the one that let it rust... and <br>
  he's not the one who had to pay for it, either. The customer paid for it. Lack <br>
  of maintinance does have it's price. <br>
  Heat up the area around the bolt a bit with a propane torch. Just do it a <br>
  bit...we are looking for about 212 degrees or so. Don't get carried away ! Now <br>
  try the Vice-Grip. <br>
  You can heat things up REALLY HOT, like cherry red with a Torch then let it <br>
  cool or even help it cool with a bit of ice. Watch out when you do it ! Wear <br>
  gloves and eye/face protection. Also, if it is a steel part in aluminum, don't <br>
  melt the aluminum. <br>
  Heat and cool and oil the part over and over again. Worry it ! <br>
  If the part is expensive or "...you just can't get them anymore ! " TAKE YOUR <br>
  TIME ... WORRY IT ! <br>
  If the shaft is really in there and will not come out or if it broke off level <br>
  with the case , take a center punch and put a deep punch right in the center <br>
  of the screw shaft. That is to help start a drill. Now drill a small hole down <br>
  into the shaft. Start pretty small and then go to the next size larger drill. <br>
  As soon as you have a big enough hole try to use an easy-out type of tool on <br>
  it. Turn the tool gently. If you get carried away and break off the easy-out <br>
  in the hole you will NEVER get it out. Easy-outs are made of very hard metal <br>
  and you cannot drill them out. I suppose you could heat them red hot and take <br>
  the temper out of them but... just don't break them, OK ? <br>
  If it still will not come out you will have to keep drilling, going up one <br>
  step ( or size ) at a time until you hit the threads. Then get in there with a <br>
  needle and kinda peel the threads of the screw out from the threads of the <br>
  case. I know that sounds kinda weird, but I've done it many times. If your <br>
  starting punch hole is off center it will make things harder but it can still <br>
  be done. If you've really buggered up the case threads, as will sometimes <br>
  happen, you can put in new threads called Helicoils. They are, however, <br>
  somewhat expensive. <br>
  You can get drills that are left handed. You then drill into the metal with <br>
  the electric drill set in reverse. This can be handy. Sometimes, as you go up <br>
  in drill sizes, you reach the magic spolt when the pressure keeping the stuck <br>
  shaft stuck dissapears. The shaft will unscrew and come off on the end of the <br>
  drill. Neat ! <br>
OK, that covers screws... How about bolts ? You can use most everything we <br>
talked about with screws plus a few things more.<br>
  Use a 6-point socket. They are much stronger then the 12-point and they grip <br>
  the hex head better. <br>
  If the head is totally rounded off get the next size smaller socket and a <br>
  hammer. After making sure that whatever part that is under the rounded off <br>
  bolt head is strong to take the pounding, BEAT the socket onto the bolt with <br>
  the hammer. Gross... but it works ! <br>
  It helps to use a " guaranteed forever " type socket too ! <br>
  If the bolt is just turning and turning, but doesn't come out, the threads in <br>
  the middle of the bolt may be stripped out. Try pulling up on the bolt in some <br>
  way to engage threads that are good. Use a Vice-Grip to pull the bolt up or <br>
  stick a screw driver under the bolt head to lever it up. <br>
  If the the problem is a stripped nut and there is a lot of area around the nut <br>
  you can use a Nut Breaker <br>
  You can hacksaw the nut till it is almost through, then heat it up red hot and <br>
  touch it with a piece of ice. That will crack it the rest of the way through.<br>
