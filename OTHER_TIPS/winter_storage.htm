Note</STRONG></U></FONT> <BR>These instructions are intended to be followed 
<U>in order</U>. The purpose of this order is to minimize the bike's exposure to 
corrosive agents and prolong its life &amp; good looks as much as possible. This 
guide assumes that the vehicle is being stored for more than a month and less 
than a year. There may be other storage procedures you should follow if you plan 
to store the vehicle for longer. For storage of less than a month in 
temperatures that don't go below freezing, you don't really need to do anything 
to the bike. (Unless you have an alarm system that may drain the battery, in 
which case you need to charge the battery, disconnect the alarm, or prepare to 
deal with a dead battery.) If it's going to get below freezing, bring the 
battery indoors -- you don't want it to freeze. <BR><BR>You may have another way 
that you handle winter storage. That's fine. I'd love to hear any suggestions 
that you may have -- please <A href="mailto:clarity.net@adam">mail them to 
me</A> -- maybe I can use them to make this document better. No one says you 
have to follow this stuff to the letter, but a fair amount of thought has gone 
into the order of the steps and the specific things done at each stage. Do 
please read through this whole document before you start doing anything -- the 
suggestions in later steps might affect how you go about doing some of the 
earlier ones. <BR><BR><BR>1) <A name=1><STRONG>Find a place to store it, get the 
tools you'll need</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 1-2 hours<BR>This is a good step to do as you're beginning 
  to plan the storage of the bike. Not at the last minute. 
  <LI>Find a good place to store the motorcycle. Keep it away from extreme 
  temperatures -- which pretty much means keep it inside, if possible. Chemical 
  fumes can dry out and attack the bike's organic (rubber) parts, so don't put 
  the bike in an area that will expose it to this stuff. Likewise, electric 
  motors and heaters generate ozone, which is also bad for rubber, so keep the 
  bike away from ozone sources too. 
  <LI>Don't put the bike somewhere where it'll get knocked over. Find a smooth, 
  level place that's out of the way. 
  <LI>It's probably bad to store the bike on dirt, where moisture rising out of 
  the soil could collect under a cover and cause your bike's tender metal bits 
  some grief. So make sure it's stored on a dry surface. 
  <LI><U>Very important</U>: go to the local auto-parts place and buy a can of 
  fuel system stabilizer. Virtually any brand will do. It's not expensive. 
  <LI>Shopping list: 
  <UL>
    <LI>gasoline stabilizer 
    <LI>enough <U>cheap</U> oil to do an <A 
    href="winter_storage.htm#3">oil change</A> 
    <LI>a new oil filter (OEM preferred) 
    <LI>any cleaning chemicals that you plan to use when <A 
    href="winter_storage.htm#9">washing &amp; 
    waxing</A> the bike </LI></UL>
  <LI>You might also want to buy (if you don't already have) any tools that you 
  will need to take the bike's gas tank, bodywork, windscreen, and spark plugs 
  off. </LI></UL>2) <A name=2><STRONG>Run the bike, fill the tank, stabilize the 
gas</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 1-2 hours<BR>(You're about to <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#9">wash the bike</A>, 
  so it's OK to take it for one final ride on salt-infested roads.) 
  <LI>Take the bike out for a spin, and on the way back, fill the tank up. You 
  may want to add the gasoline stabilizer that you bought <EM>right before</EM> 
  you fill the tank, as that'll mix things up better. You want to make sure the 
  tank is full when you store the bike, so wait until the end of the ride to 
  visit the local gas station. 
  <LI>You want to get the bike nice and hot, so make sure you're out for long 
  enough to get the engine up to operating temperature for a while. Ride around 
  for at least 20 minutes before visiting the gas station. Getting the engine 
  nice 'n hot does two good things: 
  <UL>
    <LI>a) It burns off any condensation that's formed in the engine. 
    <LI>b) It gets the oil hot, which stirs up evil combustion by-products and 
    makes it easier to remove them when you do the oil change. </LI></UL>
  <LI>If you haven't already, add the appropriate amount of gasoline stabilizer 
  to the tank when you return to the storage location. You will need to run the 
  bike for another 5 minutes or so to make sure that stabilized fuel has worked 
  its way through the entire fuel system. Be careful about the build-up of 
  poisonous carbon monoxide fumes if your bike is stored in an enclosed space. 
  <UL>
    <LI>Warning for those of you with pretty/shiny/chromey pipes: running a 
    stationary bike for an extended period of time may slightly discolor your 
    shiny pipes due to a lack of cooling airflow. Keep this in mind.</LI></UL>
  <LI>Stabilizing the gas is probably the most important thing to do when 
  storing your bike. Gasoline is a blend of dozens of different compounds. Over 
  time, the more volatile compounds will evaporate, leaving a hard sludge that 
  will <A 
  href="./winter_storage_files/dirtycarb-side.jpg">gunk 
  up your carburetors</A> and prevent them from working. Gasoline stabilizer 
  (largely) prevents this from happening. <U>You must stabilize the gasoline in 
  your fuel system before storing your bike</U>! Even if your bike doesn't have 
  carburetors. 
  <LI>Because I get so many questions about draining the float bowls, I wrote a 
  little section on <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#float">why I don't 
  drain my bikes' float bowls</A> at the end of this document. </LI></UL>3) <A 
name=3><STRONG>Change the oil</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 1 hour 
  <LI>Change the oil before you store the bike. Old oil contains combustion 
  by-products and other nasty stuff. So do an oil <U>and</U> filter change now 
  that the bike is still warm from being run. This is probably the second-most 
  important step of storage, and possibly the only one that will cause permanent 
  damage if skipped. 
  <LI>Make sure you dispose of the old oil properly -- many states have laws 
  requiring auto-parts stores to accept old oil for recycling. 
  <LI>Some dangerously misguided guides suggest filling the engine cases with 
  oil. <EM><U>Do not do this</U>.</EM> Do a <U>normal</U> oil change and put the 
  <U>normal</U> amount of oil in as listed in your owner's manual. Given the 
  other things you'll be doing here, you're taking excellent care of your engine 
  -- don't worry. Filling the cases is both wasteful and dangerous; if you start 
  the engine with oil-filled cases, you stand a decent chance of seriously 
  breaking the engine. 
  <LI>Also, you're probably going to get rid of this oil fairly early next 
  season, so don't get the latest, greatest, $9/quart synthetic ambrosia. Get 
  cheap-ass oil. If you're paying more than $1.25/qt, you're paying too much. 
  <LI>After you change the oil, move the bike to a well-ventilated area and 
  start it. Running the engine for a minute or two will distribute the fresh oil 
  throughout the engine, insuring that the remnants of the old oil are diluted. 
  After a minute or two, kill the engine and, if applicable, move the bike back 
  to the area where it will be stored. 
  <UL>
    <LI><U>Only</U> do this post-oil-change step if the engine is still warm 
    from <A href="winter_storage.htm#2">step 
    2</A>. Don't do this step if the engine has cooled, as running the engine 
    briefly will just form condensation in the engine. (This is the same reason 
    why you don't want to run the engine during the winter.) </LI></UL></LI></UL>4) 
<A name=4><STRONG>Put the bike on stands</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 5-10 minutes 
  <LI>If you have a centerstand, you're all set. Put the bike up on the 
  centerstand and skip to <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#5">section 5</A>, 
  below. If you don't have a centerstand, read on... 
  <LI>If you have a pair of bike stands (a swingarm stand and either a fork 
  stand or a front-end stand that holds the bike from the steering stem), cool. 
  Put the bike up on the stands and store it that way. 
  <LI>If you don't have stands, don't risk dropping the bike by trying to rig up 
  something with boards, jack stands, milk crates, etc. It's not that critical. 
  Just remember that you may want to take a little more care with tires over the 
  course of the winter. (See below.) </LI></UL>5) <A name=5><STRONG>Spray fogging 
oil in cylinder(s)</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 10 minutes - 2 hours 
  <LI>You may need to remove the gas tank to access the spark plugs. On some 
  models (e.g., Yamaha FZR400) you may even need to loosen or remove the 
  radiator or oil cooler. Or sacrifice small animals or hire a contortionist or 
  something -- some spark plugs are <EM>very</EM> well hidden. BMW and 
  Moto-Guzzi owners are laughing at the rest of us right now. 
  <LI>After clearing out dirt/grit from around the spark plug holes (compressed 
  air is great for this), remove the spark plugs and spray some "fogging oil" 
  (available at motorcycle or marine shops) into the cylinders. If you can't get 
  some, try harder. But if you <U>still</U> can't get some, squirt in <EM>a 
  little</EM> motor oil (or, failing <EM>that</EM>, some WD40) to lubricate the 
  cylinder walls. (Not more than a teaspoon per cylinder!) If, for whatever 
  reason, you can't get the spark plugs out -- and if you're feeling up to it -- 
  pop the carburetors off and spray some oil in via the intakes. But make sure 
  you spin the engine a bit using the rear wheel top gear trick (see next 
  paragraph) to make sure closed intake valves don't prevent oil from getting 
  into all cylinders. 
  <LI>If your bike has a centerstand, or you've raised it off the ground with 
  other stands, put the bike in the top gear and (by hand) rotate the rear wheel 
  to slowly spin the enigne. Make sure the ignition is switched off when you do 
  this, and don't use the starter in lieu of spinning the rear wheel by hand. 
  After ~10-15 revolutions, the cylinder walls will be well coated and you can 
  move on. 
  <UL>
    <LI>If you're not going to be able to get the rear wheel off the ground to 
    spin it and spread the oil around, make sure you use fogging oil (preferred) 
    or WD40. They'll distribute themselves a bit better than a little squirt of 
    motor oil. </LI></UL>
  <LI>Don't bother buying "Marvel Mystery Oil." You no doubt have some motor oil 
  left over from the oil change you just did -- if you don't have fogging oil, 
  use some of the leftover motor oil. All you're trying to do is lube the 
  cylinder walls and prevent the rings from sticking. Motor oil will do a 
  marvelous job -- this is <EM>precisely</EM> what it's engineered to do. No 
  mystery products required. 
  <LI>Reinstall the spark plugs, being careful not to cross-thread them. You may 
  want to dab <EM>a little</EM> anti-sieze on them to protect the threads that 
  they screw into. 
  <LI>If you were able to put the bike in top gear and rotate the rear wheel, 
  put the bike back in neutral. You may need to spin the rear wheel a bit to 
  help the transmission shift. 
  <LI>Briefly skip ahead to <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#6">the next section</A> 
  for a quick note on covering the air box's intakes. 
  <LI>If you had to remove the gas tank or radiator, make sure they get 
  reinstalled properly. </LI></UL>6) <A name=6><STRONG>Cover 
intake/exhaust</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 10 minutes 
  <LI><U>After the exhaust pipes have cooled</U> but preferably while the engine 
  is still warm, squirt a little WD40 into each exhaust pipe and cover the 
  tip(s) of them with a balloon or a plastic bag to prevent moisture from 
  getting to the engine. Make sure it's airtight -- rubber bands work well for 
  this. 
  <LI>Likewise, cover the air box's intake(s). If you need to remove the gas 
  tank to spray fogging oil into the cylinders (<A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#5">previous step</A>), 
  you can cover the air box's intake(s) while you have it off. (Aren't you glad 
  you followed my advice and read the whole document before starting?) 
  <LI>You may also want to cover the air box's drain hose. </LI></UL>7) <A 
name=7><STRONG>Final fuel system checks</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 5 minutes 
  <LI>If you followed <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#2">step 2</A> properly, 
  stabilized gas has worked its way through the whole fuel system, and you 
  <EM>do not</EM> need to drain the carburetors' float bowls. (<A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#float">See below</A> 
  for more info.) 
  <LI>If your fuel petcock has settings like ON/RES/PRI, leave the petcock set 
  to "ON." If your petcock has settings like ON/RES/OFF, switch the petcock to 
  "OFF." 
  <LI>If your bike doesn't have a fuel petcock, possibly because it's fuel 
  injected, you're a lucky bastard. Skip to <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#8">the next step</A>. 
  </LI></UL>8) <A name=8><STRONG>Remove and charge the battery</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 5-45 minutes 
  <LI>The bike doesn't need its battery over the winter, and you want to prevent 
  it from freezing. So <U>take it out, take it inside, and keep it charged</U>. 
  <UL>
    <LI>Batteries contain a lot of water, and water expands slightly when it 
    freezes. If it gets cold enough, the water/acid solution in your battery 
    could freeze, cracking the battery when it expands slightly. (Then, when it 
    warms up, the water/acid solution melts and runs all over your bike!) 
    Freezing = bad. </LI></UL>If you're storing the bike in a place where it won't 
  be exposed to freezing temperatures, you don't need to remove the battery from 
  the bike except to do a routine annual cleaning of the battery and the bike's 
  battery box (as explained below.) Don't neglect to keep the battery charged, 
  however. 
  <LI>Keeping a lead-acid automotive battery happy means keeping it charged. The 
  best method is to put it on a smart charger, like the "Battery Tender" (approx 
  $50), that will only charge it as much as it needs to, and won't boil the 
  battery dry with overcharging. Just put your battery on the smart charger and, 
  with the exception of periodic fluid level checks and other maintenance 
  mentioned below, you can pretty much forget about it all winter. 
  <LI>If you can't afford or don't want to buy a smart charger, buy a cheap 12v 
  trickle-charger ($10 or so) and hook it up to an automatic timer, so the 
  battery gets about 30 minutes of trickle-charging a day. You may also be able 
  to rig the thing up to your garage door opener, giving the thing a few minutes 
  of charge each time the garage door is opened. A few minutes of 
  trickle-charging a day is probably sufficient to make sure the battery stays 
  charged. 
  <LI>Unless you have a maintenance-free battery, check the battery's fluid 
  levels regularly to make sure the charger isn't boiling away the electrolyte. 
  If the levels are low, add <U>distilled water only</U> to bring the levels 
  back up. 
  <LI>Charge the battery in a well-ventilated area, particularly if your battery 
  isn't "maintenance free." Batteries can emit hydrogen gas while charging, 
  which is fairly explosive. (This is why wires get hooked up in a specific 
  order when jump-starting.) 
  <LI>You'd be pretty grungy if you never took a bath, and the same is true of 
  your battery. "Maintenance free" batteries don't need any cleaning (except for 
  the terminals, as noted below) unless it looks like battery acid has leaked 
  out of them, in which case you should follow the suggested maintenance for 
  regular batteries. That being: clean the outside with a baking soda/water 
  solution to neutralize any acid that's gotten out -- unless you're 
  <EM>certain</EM> that no acid has escaped. Likewise for the inside of the 
  battery box. Then clean the outside of the battery and the inside of the 
  battery box with a warm soapy water solution -- even those of you with 
  "maintenance free" batteries and those of you who skipped the baking soda 
  step. Make sure to dry things very thoroughly afterwards!<BR><U>All 
  batteries</U>: clean the terminals with a wire brush and lube them with a 
  dielectric grease before returning the battery to service. 
  <LI>There's an old wives' tale about putting batteries on cement floors. As 
  long as the outside of the battery is clean and dry, you have nothing to worry 
  about. Pay no attention to electrical superstitions. Just prevent the battery 
  from freezing, and make sure it stays charged. </LI></UL>9) <A 
name=9><STRONG>Wash, dry, and wax the bike</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: could take <U>hours</U>... 
  <LI>Around wintertime, there's often a lot of salt on the roads. <EM>Clean 
  this stuff off before you store your bike!</EM> Mild soap and water is fine, 
  or use a bike-specific cleaning chemical if you want. Make sure you wash the 
  whole underside of the bike, the wheels, suspension components, etc. 
  <LI>And don't forget to dry the bike. The engine (which should still be hot 
  from your ride) may be able to evaporate the water off, but you'll still want 
  to get the water off the wheels, frame, etc. Drying the bike is really 
  important; do a good job. 
  <LI>Wax the bike's painted parts; it'll prevent the paint from oxidizing over 
  the winter. 
  <LI>Standard warning that everyone who owns a pressure-washer should be able 
  to recite by heart: the overwhelming pressure that pressure-washers generate 
  can do bad things to motorcycles. Take care not to point the powerful stream 
  of water at bearings, seals, etc. Water under such high pressure can force its 
  way past seals, displacing grease, corroding bearings, etc. Be careful. 
</LI></UL>10) <A name=10><STRONG>Protect the bike's exposed metal</STRONG></A> 
<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 10-30 minutes<BR><FONT color=#d01010><STRONG>Do not apply 
  chemicals or lubricants to brake pads, brake rotors, or tires.</STRONG></FONT> 
  This section is about protecting the frame, the rims, the chain, etc. <U>Don't 
  mess with the brakes.</U> If you get chemicals on them, clean them thoroughly 
  with brake cleaner. (Available at any auto parts place.) 
  <LI>To protect metal parts, spray the exposed metal parts of the bike 
  (particularly the underside) with a rust inhibitor like WD40, cosmoline, or 
  Maxima's Chain Wax shoul. (Believe it or not, Chain Wax works very well for 
  this purpose!) These chemicals will prevent rust and corrosion from making any 
  progress while the bike is in storage. You will want to do a good job of 
  removing them come spring. 
  <LI>PJ1 makes a rubber-protecting chemical that seems to keep rubber from dry 
  rotting. Although you shouldn't spray <U>any</U> chemical on your tires, other 
  rubber parts of your bike might benefit from some of this stuff. 
  <LI>Rusty spots (except on the brake rotors) should probably be attended to 
  over the winter. See the section on <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#13">stuff to do over 
  the winter</A>, below. 
  <LI>If you get any ChainWax/WD40/cosmoline/whatever on the bike's pretty 
  parts, do a little touch-up washing to prevent these chemicals from staining 
  the bike's finish over the winter. Diluted "Simple Green" (an organic 
  degreaser) followed by either Honda Pro Oils "Spray Cleaner &amp; Polish" or 
  Meguire's "Quick Detailer" should work well. </LI></UL>11) <A

<UL>ESTIMATED TIME: 5 minutes 
  <LI>Depending on where you store your bike, you may want to put a big-ass lock 
  on it to make sure it stays put. Keep in mind that determined thieves can cut 
  through just about anything, and the best protection against theft is probably 
  insurance. 
  <LI>On that note, you may not be able to insure the bike against theft 
  ("comprehensive") if you cancel the registration or stop carrying 
  collision/liability coverage over the winter. Check with your insurance agent 
  to make sure you're receiving the coverage that you want. 
  <LI>Buy a big, heavy chain (Cobra-Links or Kryptonite's Barbed Wire come to 
  mind), and lock the <U>frame</U> of the bike to something relatively 
  immovable. And cover the thing (see below) -- covers are probably better theft 
  protection than any lock. </LI></UL>12) <A name=12><STRONG>Cover the

  <LI>Make sure the bike has been well-dried after the washing it got in <A

  <LI>Use a breathable cloth cover. You don't want to trap moisture under the 
  cover, as it'll cause rust. Likewise, you want to keep water out, particularly 
  if you're storing the bike outside, where it'll be subjected to precipitation. 
  Purpose-made bike covers work well, as does anything made of Gore-Tex.

  <LI>A lot of this maintenance will seem intimidating to people who haven't

  the more involved tasks when you feel up to it. Or find friends who are more 
  experienced with bike maintenance and bribe them to help you. 
  <LI>If you didn't have stands to get the tires off the ground, make sure you 
  check the tires every month or so to make sure they're at normal operating 
  pressure. You may also wish to move the bike slightly every few weeks to 
  prevent flat spots. (Or maybe this is another old wives' tale. "Your Mileage 
  May Vary.") 
  <LI>Clean up any rust spots with some very fine grit sand paper (until you get 
  down to bare metal) and repaint the area with a matching color. (This does not 
  apply to the brake system, of course -- as previously noted, leave the brakes 
  alone.) Paint will <U>not</U> cure properly when it's really cold out, so if 
  you aren't storing the bike somewhere warm, you might as well skip this step 
  until the ambient temperature is over 65 degrees or so.

    fireplace/stove paint (available at many hardware stores or specialty 
    fireplace stores.) If you can track down a high-temperature etching primer, 
    that'd be a good thing to use between the sanding and the first coat of 
    paint. (The exhaust system gets so hot that conventional paints will be

<UL><STRONG><U>Why Things Are In The Order They're In</U></STRONG> 
  <LI><A href="winter_storage.htm#1">Step one</A> 
  is basic preparation. Get the tools for the job. 
  <LI><A href="winter_storage.htm#2">Step two</A> 
  is <STRONG>critical</STRONG> because the engine needs to be up to temperature 
  for the oil change, the fuel system needs to be stabilized and the tank filled 
  (to prevent rust inside the tank), and a hot engine will burn off any residual 
  condensation or water in the engine/oil. These steps were combined because 
  they can all be done together, as long as they're done in the proper order. 
  <LI><A href="winter_storage.htm#3">Steps 
  three</A> is done before <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#4">step four</A> only 
  because the post-oil-change engine running needs to be done in a 
  well-ventilated area. That means moving the bike. Putting the bike up on 
  stands before the oil change would make the oil change easier, but then you'd 
  just need to take it off the stands when you moved it. 
  <LI><A href="winter_storage.htm#4">Steps 
  four</A> through <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#8">eight</A> don't 
  <U>need</U> to be done in any particular order, but they need to be done after 
  the engine is run and while it's still fairly hot. 
  <LI><A href="winter_storage.htm#9">Step nine</A> 
  is where it is because some of the earlier steps may get oil on the bike, and, 
  besides, it's nice to give the bike a chance to cool down (a little) before 
  you wash it, since otherwise you could burn yourself. 
  <LI>You could make a good argument that <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#10">step ten</A> should 
  go before <A href="winter_storage.htm#9">step 
  nine</A>, since there's a good chance that overspray will get oil on the 
  bike's pretty parts. I put <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#10">ten</A> 
  <EM>after</EM> <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#9">step nine</A> 
  because <A href="winter_storage.htm#9">step 
  nine</A> will wash off salt and corrosion, which is precisely what you want to 
  do before you spray metal-protecting chemicals on the bike's tender metal 
  bits. Otherwise you run the risk of sealing the corrosive agents in. 
  <LI>If you think of a good reason that the order should be different, please 
  <A href="mailto:clarity.net@adam">send me email</A> and I'll try to work your 
  suggestion(s) in. <BR><BR><A name=float></A>
  <LI>And finally, <STRONG>why I don't drain my bikes' float 
  bowls:</STRONG><BR>The gas stabilizer will prevent the gas from turning solid. 
  I mean, there are no guarantees in life, but in my experience, the stuff works 
  as advertised. Since you're stabilizing the gas, do you also need to drain the 
  float bowls? I dunno. I don't bother, some friends do, and none of us have had 
  problems -- <U>provided we stabilize the gas first</U>. If you're <U>not</U> 
  going to stabilize the gas, yes, absolutely, you must get <U>all</U> of the 
  gas out of the carbs. The problem with <U>only</U> draining the float bowls is 
  that you haven't removed all of the gas from the carburetor -- capillary 
  action can hold fuel in the small passages inside the carburetor. And 
  <U>that's</U> the stuff that's going to clog the carb's operation, even if you 
  turn the engine over a bit afterwards. Here are a couple of pictures of what 
  can happen if you don't <A 
  href="winter_storage.htm#2">stabilize the 
  gas</A>: <A 
  href="./winter_storage_files/dirtycarb-side.jpg">1</A> 
  / <A 
  href="./winter_storage_files/dirtycarb-bot.jpg">2</A> 
  / <A 
  href="./winter_storage_files/dirtycarb-side2.jpg">3</A>. 
  As you can see, the inside of the carb is covered in a jelly-like ooze that 
  has completely blocked the jets. This carb is completely useless as shown ... 
  complete disassembly and extended soaking in solvents was required to get it 
  working again. Anyway... your carbs would continue to work fine with this 
  sludgy jelly at the bottom of the float bowls as long as the sludge didn't 
  interfere with movement of the floats or clog any jets. The float bowls are 
  just little puddles of gas; they still work just fine as puddles of gas if 
  there's a little sludge stuck to the bottom of the puddle. But if the tiny 
  passages get clogged... it's all over. And there's no good way to get them 
  completely clean short of removing the carbs and cleaning them with carb 
  cleaner and compressed air. (Which is easy and a good idea though 
  time-consuming -- if you know how to do it, but intimidating if you're not 
  used to working on your bike.) Thus the most important step, by far, is to 
  stabilize the gas. After that, I don't think it makes much difference whether 
  or not you drain the float bowls, since stabilized gas won't turn into sludge. 
  Even the stuff being held in the jets by capillary action. I think. </LI></UL><!-- ZoneLabs Popup Blocking Insertion -->
