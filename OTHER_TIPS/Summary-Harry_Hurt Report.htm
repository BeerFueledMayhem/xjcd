Motorcycle Accident Cause Factors and Identification of Countermeasures <P>
A motorcycle accident study offers you a wealth of information about accidents and how to avoid them.<P> 
The "Motorcycle Accident Cause Factors and Identification of Countermeasures," is a study conducted by the University of Southern California (USC). With funds from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, researcher Harry Hurt investigated almost every aspect of 900 motorcycle accidents in the Los Angeles area. Additionally, Hurt and his staff analyzed 3,600 motorcycle traffic accident reports in the same geographic area.<P>

"Motorcycle Accident Cause Factors and Identification of Countermeasures"<BR>
Throughout the accident and exposure data there are special observations 
which relate to accident and injury causation and characteristics of the 
motorcycle accidents studied. These findings are summarized as follows:
<ol>
<li>Approximately three-fourths of these motorcycle accidents involved 
collision with another vehicle, which was most usually a passenger 
automobile.
<li>Approximately one-fourth of these motorcycle accidents were single 
vehicle accidents involving the motorcycle colliding with the roadway or 
some fixed object in the environment.
<li>Vehicle failure accounted for less than 3% of these motorcycle 
accidents, and most of those were single vehicle accidents where control 
was lost due to a puncture flat.
<li>In the single vehicle accidents, motorcycle rider error was present 
as the accident precipitating factor in about two-thirds of the cases, 
with the typical error being a slideout and fall due to overbraking or 
running wide on a curve due to excess speed or under-cornering.
<li>Roadway defects (pavement ridges, potholes, etc.) were the accident 
cause in 2% of the accidents; animal involvement was 1% of the accidents.
<li>In the multiple vehicle accidents, the driver of the other vehicle 
violated the motorcycle right-of-way and caused the accident in 
two-thirds of those accidents.
<li>The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in 
traffic is the predominating cause of motorcycle accidents. The driver of 
the other vehicle involved in collision with the motorcycle did not see 
the motorcycle before the collision, or did not see the motorcycle until 
too late to avoid the collision.
<li>Deliberate hostile action by a motorist against a motorcycle rider 
is a rare accident cause. The most frequent accident configuration is the 
motorcycle proceeding straight then the automobile makes a left turn in 
front of the oncoming motorcycle.
<li>Intersections are the most likely place for the motorcycle 
accident, with the other vehicle violating the motorcycle right-of-way, 
and often violating traffic controls.
<li>Weather is not a factor in 98% of motorcycle accidents.
<li>Most motorcycle accidents involve a short trip associated with 
shopping, errands, friends, entertainment or recreation, and the accident 
is likely to happen in a very short time close to the trip origin.
<li>The view of the motorcycle or the other vehicle involved in the 
accident is limited by glare or obstructed by other vehicles in almost 
half of the multiple vehicle accidents.
<li>Conspicuity of the motorcycle is a critical factor in the multiple 
vehicle accidents, and accident involvement is significantly reduced by 
the use of motorcycle headlamps (on in daylight) and the wearing of high 
visibility yellow, orange or bright red jackets.
<li>Fuel system leaks and spills were present in 62% of the motorcycle 
accidents in the post-crash phase. This represents an undue hazard for 
fire.
<li>The median pre-crash speed was 29.8 mph, and the median crash 
speed was 21.5 mph, and the one-in-a-thousand crash speed is 
approximately 86 mph.
<li>The typical motorcycle pre-crash lines-of-sight to the traffic 
hazard portray no contribution of the limits of peripheral vision; more 
than three-fourths of all accident hazards are within 45deg of either 
side of straight ahead.
<li>Conspicuity of the motorcycle is most critical for the frontal 
surfaces of the motorcycle and rider.
<li>Vehicle defects related to accident causation are rare and likely 
to be due to deficient or defective maintenance.
<li>Motorcycle riders between the ages of 16 and 24 are significantly 
overrepresented in accidents; motorcycle riders between the ages of 30 
and 50 are significantly underrepresented. Although the majority of the 
accident-involved motorcycle riders are male (96%), the female 
motorcycles riders are significantly overrepresented in the accident 
data.
<li>Craftsmen, laborers, and students comprise most of the 
accident-involved motorcycle riders. Professionals, sales workers, and 
craftsmen are underrepresented and laborers, students and unemployed are 
overrepresented in the accidents.
<li>Motorcycle riders with previous recent traffic citations and 
accidents are overrepresented in the accident data.
<li>The motorcycle riders involved in accidents are essentially 
without training; 92% were self-taught or learned from family or friends. 
Motorcycle rider training experience reduces accident involvement and is 
related to reduced injuries in the event of accidents.
<li>More than half of the accident-involved motorcycle riders had less 
than 5 months experience on the accident motorcycle, although the total 
street riding experience was almost 3 years. Motorcycle riders with dirt 
bike experience are significantly underrepresented in the accident data.
<li>Lack of attention to the driving task is a common factor for the 
motorcyclist in an accident.
<li>Almost half of the fatal accidents show alcohol involvement.
<li>Motorcycle riders in these accidents showed significant collision 
avoidance problems. Most riders would overbrake and skid the rear wheel, 
and underbrake the front wheel greatly reducing collision avoidance 
deceleration. The ability to countersteer and swerve was essentially 
absent.
<li>The typical motorcycle accident allows the motorcyclist just less 
than 2 seconds to complete all collision avoidance action.
<li>Passenger-carrying motorcycles are not overrepresented in the 
accident area.
<li>The driver of the other vehicles involved in collision with the 
motorcycle are not distinguished from other accident populations except 
that the ages of 20 to 29, and beyond 65 are overrepresented.
Also, these drivers are generally unfamiliar with motorcycles.
<li>The large displacement motorcycles are underrepresented in 
accidents but they are associated with higher injury severity when 
involved in accidents.
<li>Any effect of motorcycle color on accident involvement is not 
determinable from these data, but is expected to be insignificant because 
the frontal surfaces are most often presented to the other vehicle 
involved in the collision.
<li>Motorcycles equipped with fairings and windshields are 
underrepresented in accidents, most likely because of the contribution to 
conspicuity and the association with more experienced and trained riders.
<li>Motorcycle riders in these accidents were significantly without 
motorcycle license, without any license, or with license revoked.
<li>Motorcycle modifications such as those associated with the 
semi-chopper or cafe racer are definitely overrepresented in accidents.
<li>Likelihood of injury is extremely high in these motorcycle 
accidents-98% of the multiple vehicle collisions and 96% of the single 
vehicle accidents resulted in some kind of injury to the motorcycle 
rider; 45% resulted in more than a minor injury.
<li>Half of the injuries to the somatic regions were to the 
ankle-foot, lower leg, knee, and thigh-upper leg.
<li>Crash bars are not an effective injury countermeasure; the 
reduction of injury to the ankle-foot is balanced by increase of injury 
to the thigh-upper leg, knee, and lower leg.
<li>The use of heavy boots, jacket, gloves, etc., is effective in 
preventing or reducing abrasions and lacerations, which are frequent but 
rarely severe injuries.
<li>Groin injuries were sustained by the motorcyclist in at least 13% 
of the accidents, which typified by multiple vehicle collision in frontal 
impact at higher than average speed.
<li>Injury severity increases with speed, alcohol involvement and 
motorcycle size.
<li>Seventy-three percent of the accident-involved motorcycle riders 
used no eye protection, and it is likely that the wind on the unprotected 
eyes contributed in impairment of vision which delayed hazard detection.
<li>Approximately 50% of the motorcycle riders in traffic were using 
safety helmets but only 40% of the accident-involved motorcycle riders 
were wearing helmets at the time of the accident.
<li>Voluntary safety helmet use by those accident-involved motorcycle 
riders was lowest for untrained, uneducated, young motorcycle riders on 
hot days and short trips.
<li>The most deadly injuries to the accident victims were injuries to 
the chest and head.
<li>The use of the safety helmet is the single critical factor in the 
prevention of reduction of head injury; the safety helmet which complies 
with FMVSS 218 is a significantly effective injury countermeasure.
<li>Safety helmet use caused no attenuation of critical traffic 
sounds, no limitation of precrash visual field, and no fatigue or loss of 
attention; no element of accident causation was related to helmet use.
<li>FMVSS 218 provides a high level of protection in traffic 
accidents, and needs modification only to increase coverage at the back 
of the head and demonstrate impact protection of the front of full facial 
coverage helmets, and insure all adult sizes for traffic use are covered 
by the standard.
<li>Helmeted riders and passengers showed significantly lower head and 
neck injury for all types of injury, at all levels of injury severity.
<li>The increased coverage of the full facial coverage helmet 
increases protection, and significantly reduces face injuries.
<li>There is not liability for neck injury by wearing a safety helmet; 
helmeted riders had less neck injuries than unhelmeted riders. Only four 
minor injuries were attributable to helmet use, and in each case the 
helmet prevented possible critical or fatal head injury.
<li>Sixty percent of the motorcyclists were not wearing safety helmets 
at the time of the accident. Of this group, 26% said they did not wear 
helmets because they were uncomfortable and inconvenient, and 53% simply 
had no expectation of accident involvement.
<li>Valid motorcycle exposure data can be obtained only from 
collection at the traffic site. Motor vehicle or driver license data 
presents information which is completely unrelated to actual use.
<li>Less than 10% of the motorcycle riders involved in these accidents 
had insurance of any kind to provide medical care or replace property.
