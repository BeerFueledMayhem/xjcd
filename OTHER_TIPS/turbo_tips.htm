<font face="Times New Roman" class="fsx05" color="#000000">Tips:<br>
Here is the first one. I recently fitted my seca with a fork brace. The front <br>
forks are weak for this size of a bike so they flex alot. If you want to know <br>
how much just put on a fork brace and you will see. The part clamps to both <br>
tubes just above the fender and prevents them from flexing. The model I used was <br>
from Telefix. You can order this part for the SECA TURBO, from SPEC II. The bike <br>
will either take the FS10 model or if it is too big, you will have to switch to <br>
the FS7 model. My bikes use the FS7 model.<br>

----------------------------------------<br>
Has your windscreen turned yellow? Or is just not as clear as it once was? My <br>
bike suffered from this. When I first go the bike the screen was not transparent <br>
at all. To turn it back to clear there a few things you can do. I used Plexus at <br>
first, usually carried at all motorcycle shops. It worked good, but its just a <br>
part time cure. The best thing I have found to use is some mother's aluminum rim <br>
polish, it comes in a little white can and you just use like you would to polish <br>
a rim. Dont hit the paint on the headlight nacelle or you can make it look <br>
pretty bad. Use a terry cloth towel and put some elbow grease into it. After <br>
using that seal it with a little turttle wax, paste is better for this, but you <br>
can use some liquid. This and a little buffing will have that screen clear in no <br>
time.<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
I have noticed that this bike's electrical connectors tend to corrode. Check <br>
them periodically, and use some WD40 or LPS 1 to keep them clean and in good <br>
contact. I coated all my connectors with electrical grade grease, it keeps the <br>
moisture out and keeps the connection constant.<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
If your petcock starts to leak gas there is a couple of thing you will need to <br>
know. Sometimes you can flip the rubber gasket over to get a nice new surface to <br>
seal, this is really good because parts for this machine have to be ordered <br>
always and this will get you up and running while you wait for new parts. Dont <br>
let the dealer or other shops order the wrong part, they will try to give you <br>
the one for thevacum petcock on the regular xj650. I think the microfiche may <br>
call for that. If you have the owners manual you may notice a piece of paper has <br>
been glued on the page for the operation of the fuel petcock. I think they <br>
originaly tried to fit this bike with a vacum petcock. Boost means no vacum, so <br>
there is no more fuel flow. Who knows, they tried to give me the regular one and <br>
it was cheaper for me to buy it in pieces.<br>
