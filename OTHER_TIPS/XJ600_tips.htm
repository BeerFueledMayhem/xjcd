<br>
General <br>
<br>
The XJ 600 was made from 1992 to 1998 with little change from year to year. In 94 the windscreen was changed slightly for better wind protection, In 95 (or maybe 96?) the lower cowling was made standard. It is known as the Seca II in the states and the Diversion everywhere else. The Diversion is also available as a 900 cc in Europe. It is not to be confused with the original Seca XJ series which all have sizes ending in 50 (650,750,etc.) The Price was around $4000 US when the Seca II came out and a great bargain. The price crept up to over $5000 towards 98 and was not quite the great bargain anymore, with stiff competition from the Suzuki Bandit (I wonder where they got the idea ;) ) and others. See the Frugal flyers Shootout in the links section. <br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" class="fsx05" color="#000000">(Editor's note: In 1984 and 1985 North America got the 'FJ600' and other parts of the world got the same bike badged as the 'XJ600'. They were essentially the same chain-drive bike, reportedly based on the earlier XJ550R. This CD therefore includes parts diagrams for the FJ600)<br>

Complaints <br>
<br>
The Seca II is A nice little bike but does have a few common complaint's, Most can be fixed relatively cheaply and easily using the tip's below. <br>
<br>
The Stock Yokahama tires that came on most Seca II's are terrible. <br>
<br>
The 18" rear rim makes finding quality rear rubber a challenge and more expensive. <br>
<br>
The engine doesn't exactly overwhelm you with power. See the power chart. <br>
<br>
Very cold blooded, it doesn't like to run until it's idles at least 4-5 minutes. <br>
<br>
No center stand, makes oiling your chain a chore. <br>
<br>
The soft suspension is great for around town but a little soft for sportier riding. <br>
<br>
The fairing on the 92-93 model does not provide much wind protection. It was changed slightly in 94. <br>
<br>
Lack of a rear sub fender means any dirt kicked up by the rear tire ends up on the rear shock/ rear of engine. <br>
<br>
Since it is not a very common model, parts and accessories can be hard to find and expensive. <br>
<br>
Quick Fixes <br>
Here a few easy fixes for some of the above problems, I cannot guaranty the accuracy of all of them. <br>
<br>
See tires on the handling page. <br>
<br>
A jet kit will cure the Seca II's cold bloodedness, or get in the habit of firing up your bike before you begin the search for your riding gear. <br>
<br>
A center stand can be purchased for about $120. <br>
<br>
For a taller windscreen for your 92-93 Seca contact; Gustafsson's Plastics in St. Augustine, Florida: 1-904-824-3443. About $85-90 -- I have heard it is a little on the flimsy side but does provide more wind protection. <br>
