<br>
Haynes: Rotate anticlockwise.<br>
Translation: Clamp with molegrips then beat repeatedly with hammer<br>
anticlockwise.<br>
<br>
Haynes: This is a snug fit.<br>
Translation: You will skin your knuckles!<br>
<br>
Haynes: This is a tight fit.<br>
Translation: Not a hope in hell matey!<br>
<br>
Haynes: As described in Chapter 7...<br>
Translation: That'll teach you not to read through before you start, now<br>
you are looking at scarey photos of the inside of a gearbox.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Pry...<br>
Translation: Hammer a screwdriver into...<br>
<br>
Haynes: Undo...<br>
Translation: Go buy a tin of WD40 (catering size).<br>
<br>
Haynes: Retain tiny spring...<br>
Translation: "Jeez what was that, it nearly had my eye out"!<br>
<br>
Haynes: Press and rotate to remove bulb...<br>
Translation: OK - thats the glass bit off, now fetch some good pliers to<br>
dig out the bayonet part.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Lightly...<br>
Translation: Start off lightly and build up till the veins on your<br>
forehead are throbbing them re-check the manual because this can not be<br>
'lightly' what you are doing now.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Weekly checks...<br>
Translation: If it isn't broken don't fix it!<br>
<br>
Haynes: Routine maintenance...<br>
Translation: If it isn't broken... it's about to be!<br>
<br>
Haynes: One spanner rating.<br>
Translation: Your Mum could do this... so how did you manage to botch it<br>
up?<br>
<br>
Haynes: Two spanner rating.<br>
Translation: Now you may think that you can do this because two is a low,<br>
tiny, 'ikkle number... but you also thought the wiring diagram was a map of<br>
the Tokyo underground (in fact that would have been more use to you).<br>
<br>
Haynes: Three spanner rating.<br>
Translation: But bikes are easy to maintain right... right?<br>
<br>
Haynes: Four spanner rating.<br>
Translation: You are seriously considering this aren't you, you pleb!<br>
<br>
Haynes: Five spanner rating.<br>
Translation: OK - but don't expect us to ride it afterwards!!!<br>
<br>
Haynes: If not, you can fabricate your own special tool like this...<br>
Translation: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!<br>
<br>
Haynes: Compress...<br>
Translation: Squeeze with all your might, jump up and down on, swear at,<br>
throw at the garage wall, then search in the dark corner of the garage for<br>
whilst muttering "bugger" repeatedly under your breath.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Inspect...<br>
Translation: Squint at really hard and pretend you know what you are<br>
looking at, then declare in a loud knowing voice to your wife "Yep, as I<br>
thought, it's going to need a new one"!<br>
<br>
Haynes: Carefully...<br>
Translation: You are about to cut yourself!<br>
<br>
Haynes: Retaining nut...<br>
Translation: Yes, that's it, that big spherical blob of rust.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Get an assistant...<br>
Translation: Prepare to humiliate yourself in front of someone you know.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Turning the engine will be easier with the spark pugs removed.<br>
Translation: However, starting the engine afterwards will be much harder.<br>
Once that sinking pit of your stomach feeling has subsided, you can start to<br>
feel deeply ashamed as you gingerly refit the spark plugs.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Refitting is the reverse sequence to removal.<br>
Translation: But you swear in different places.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Prise away plastic locating pegs...<br>
Translation: Snap off...<br>
<br>
Haynes: Using a suitable drift...<br>
Translation: The biggest nail in your tool box isn't a suitable drift!<br>
<br>
Haynes: Everyday toolkit<br>
Translation: Ensure you have an RAC Card & Mobile Phone<br>
<br>
Haynes: Apply moderate heat...<br>
Translation: Placing your mouth near it and huffing isn't moderate heat.<br>
<br>
Haynes: Index<br>
Translation: List of all the things in the book bar the thing you want to<br>
do!<br>
<br>
For Added Haynes Fun:<br>
Go to the first section, Safety First, and read the bit about Hydrofluoric<br>
Acid - do you really want the advice of a book that uses this form of<br>
understatement???!!?<br>
<br>
Now look at the lovely colour section on body repairs - as you look at<br>
these two pages say to yourself over and over until it sinks in "mine will<br>
never look like that..."<br>
<br>
NB: Haynes Manuals are (c)opyright of a very disturbed sadist<br>
