<font face="Times New Roman" class="fsx05" color="#000000">What do you consider factors:<br>
cost<br>
wear<br>
traction<br>
<br>
Now you can only pick 2 of 3, though it is a bit more complex than that and must ask if you are a mostly tame rider or like to turn and burn more.  Also riding in the wet should make traction more of a factor, which usually costs more.  One can also think of good tires as a form of insurance, even if you don't ride hard.  Would rather avoid an accident than have a tire break free and lose control.  This is more of a factor in the wet and matters little when one hits a grease slick or spilled diesel fuel.  Then a tire that won't grab suddenly after sliding does help avoid a high side.  Yes, one could "what-if" the choices to death.<br>
<br>
Surely you and others have read my other posts on the is recently, which will save me some typing and will summarize a bit more and leave details to others.  Will throw in some prices later.<br>
<br>
Bridgestone's BT45 might be the most popular on the list.  Going with the V vs the H rated version will gain some traction (this is the case in general for any brand/model of tire) at a slight loss in mileage for $3 more.  One person mentioned the Michelin 50E (or the older A50 version) and M50 did better than the BT45's with those that have switched (not sure if any here have tried them or can comment/compare), yet they do cost a bit more.<br>
<br>
Those looking for excellent traction usually opt for Metzeler ME33/ME55A combo, Dunlop K591's, or the Bridgestone BT45's.  Now the ME55A is replaced by the ME550 and the K591 is replaced by the GT501 (unless you want HD lettering), but there has been little feedback on either.<br>
<br>
Could say that wear and traction with an indifference to cost then the Metzeler ME880 is the tire.  Never used the ME88, but though the tread pattern wasn't best for rain grooves (yea, another factor to consider).<br>
<br>
When one's budget is tight then Kenda Challenger's, Bridgestone's S11 Spitfire, or rock bottom Cheng Shin's Hi-Max (C906/C907).  Interestingly the tread patten for the front Hi-Max is similar to the ME33.  While mentioning CS should also say that the Marquis is to be avoided.  Don't recall offhand if the Barracuda has been mentioned in the past.  Anyone?<br>
<br>
Avon was mentioned already and a few others use them.  Most are in the UK or Europe.  From wear to traction they have the Roadrunner (AM20/AM21), Venom X, Super Venom (AM18/AM20).  Seems many are not specific when mentioning Avon's when I checked back.<br>
<br>
It appears that Metzeler is dropping the ME99A (fits between the ME880 and ME55A/ME550) and ME77<br>
<br>
Now for some pricing.  Not everyone uses the same sizes and so there might be some variations in cost, which may or may not be a factor.  In my case the size used for the ME33 does make a difference....<br>
<br>
$81.95 Metzeler ME550 130/90V16 Rear Tire<br>
<br>
$111.95 Metzeler ME55A Metronic 130/90V16 Rear Tire<br>
Note:  No longer listed, but the ME550 price has not changed since both were listed.<br>
<br>
$75.95 Metzeler ME880 100/90H19 Front Tire<br>
$96.95 Metzeler ME880 130/90HB16 Rear Tire<br>
<br>
$89.95 Metzeler ME33 Laser 325H19 Front Tire<br>
$77.95 Metzeler ME33 Laser 325V19 Front Tire<br>
$93.95 Metzeler ME33 Laser 110/90V19 Front Tire<br>
$85.95 Metzeler ME33 Laser 350H19 Front Tire<br>
$93.95 Metzeler ME33 Laser 350V19 Front Tire<br>
Note:  The 110/90 is a tight fit (ask Brad) and the 350H19 may or may not.  The 325V19 costs less and is what I use.<br>
<br>
<br>
$71.95 Dunlop GT501 57V 100/90V19 Front Tire<br>
$82.95 Dunlop GT501 67V 130/90VB16 Rear Tire<br>
<br>
<br>
$79.95 Bridgestone BT45H 130/90H16 Rear Tire<br>
$70.95 Bridgestone BT45V 100/90V19 Front Tire<br>
$82.95 Bridgestone BT45V 130/90V16 Rear Tire<br>
Note:  No "H" rated for front.<br>
<br>
$54.95 Bridgestone S11 100/90H19 Front Tire<br>
$65.95 Bridgestone S11 130/90H16 Rear Tire<br>
<br>
<br>
$78.95 Michelin Macadam 50E 100/90V19 Front Tire<br>
$95.95 Michelin Macadam M50 130/90V16 Rear Tire<br>
Comment:  Curious on the wear of the M50 rear.  A bit pricey if it wears the same as tires with similar traction.<br>
<br>
<br>
The next 3 brands are on my tire price list for the first time.  Figure they get mentioned enough and some are on a budget, so might as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
(no size available for the AM20 front)<br>
$93.95 Avon AM21 Roadrunner 130/90H16 Rear Tire<br>
$72.95 Avon Venom X 100/90H19 Front Tire<br>
$98.95 Avon Venom X MT90H16 Rear Tire<br>
$75.95 Avon AM18 Super Venom 100/90V19 Front/Rear Tire<br>
$88.95 Avon AM18 Super Venom 130/90V16 Rear Tire<br>
<br>
<br>
$35.95 Kenda K657 Sport Challenger 100/90H19 Front Tire<br>
$43.95 Kenda K657 Sport Challenger 130/90H16 Rear Tire<br>
Note:  Tread pattern is an old Bridgestone design.<br>
<br>
$38.95 Kenda K671 100/90H19 Front Tire<br>
$44.95 Kenda K671 130/90H16 Rear Tire<br>
Comment:  The patter for the front is similar to the Michelin and is more modern than the K657.<br>
<br>
<br>
$34.95 Cheng Shin C906 Himax 100/90H19 Tubeless Front Tire<br>
$44.95 Cheng Shin C907 Himax 130/90H16 Rear Tire<br>
<br>
In some cases the blank may just be an inventory gap.  Didn't feel like checking all the sites to verify.<br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing to note is that a front typically will outlast the rear by a 2:1 ratio.  Then I did toast 3 ME55A's to one ME33 and some a 1.5:1 ratio.  Paying a bit more for the front makes a lot of sense, as most of the "more preferred" ones will last 10-20K miles.  Unless you ride a lot, chances are the front will dry rot before being worn down with a longer lasting tire, so a bit more grip is worth the wear.  Then I'm not fond of changing both at the same time.  Either one has to be well broken in my view.  Similarly, some prefer a better wearing rear and then you have a better cost-per-mile from release to cords.  Of course you should take it easy during break-in to scuff of the release compound and wearing to the cords is not the best, even if I have been there and so some burn outs and then replace it the next day. <g><br>
<br>
Will say it would be nice to hear back on the ME550 and if anyone can fit one, the ME330.  They are priced close to the Dunlop GT501 and Bridgestone BT45.  Someone mentioned the Avon's were expensive in their area, but was surprised.<br>
<br>
If there are another others that some would like added to the list, speak up.  Comments are also good, as I keep a kind of vague mental score.  Also a good idea to write down the mileage when you change tires.  Keeping a vehicle log is handy.  In my case I dig for receipts, but mileage is more helpful.  At some point I plan to automate pulling the tire info and write up a standard plug for a web site based on what is discussed on the list, so details are helpful.  Not sure I'd go so far as to have a feedback/report database, but it's an idea and plan to use one to print up sizes for all brands and models in the list.  Perhaps compare places, depends on how complex that is.<br>
<br>
Something more I wanted to say, but guess I'm too *tired* at this point.  8-)<br>
