After 12,000 km of hard riding to the East Coast and north to James Bay, <br>
Yamaha's Seca keeps its polish   <br>
<br>
You can't help but notice the Yamaha Seca 750. Its unique, integrated styling and    <br>
modern technology set it apart from the crowd. But what's below the glitzy <br>
surface? How will the motorcycle stand up to long, hard use? Will the   <br>
computerized instruments go crystals up after exposure to     the elements? And <br>
what about     the engine? Twelve-second     quarter-mile times require     plenty <br>
of horsepower, and the     more power, the shorter the     fuse.  <br>
We conducted a 12,000 km long-term test of the Seca, touring and tearing under <br>
every imaginable weather condition, two-up and solo. Now we have the answers. <br>
The 750 Seca is durable. Cosmetically, our test bike dould pass for new after a <br>
good cleaning. The paintwork is still Brilliant Red as Yamaha calls it, protected by <br>
a thick coat of clear lacquer. Neither exposure to the sun nor a tankbag fitted for <br>
a Maritime tour has dulled the finish. Windblown debris from truck wake on the <br>
highway failed to scratch or nick any part of the motorcycle.  <br>
The engine has been as reliable as a hammer. There are no oil leaks anywhere, <br>
just minor weepage where the driveshaft housing joins the differential.  <br>
Oil consumption under normal riding conditions is so small as to be insignificant. <br>
When pushed hard -- 1,100 km in 12 hours, two-up with luggage -- the level <br>
would drop slightly, reassuring the rider that valve guides and piston rings were <br>
receiving adequate lubrication for the job asked of them. Consumption returned to <br>
normal when riding did.  <br>
The engine is unchanged from the 1981 model with the exception of black paint <br>
on the camcover and cylinder block. It may be there for looks alone, to distinguish <br>
the bike from the older version, or to help cooling. It's worth noting that unlike the <br>
Canadian Seca 650 and the European Seca 750, this Seca 750 does not come <br>
with an oil cooler. Under conditioris of high speed and load, an oil cooler would <br>
make life easier for the 3.5 litres of engine oil. Yamaha recommends that the oil <br>
be changed every 3,000 kmand the filter every 6,000 km. Do it more often if you <br>
run the bike hard.   <br>
Performance has not declined with the passing kilometres. It has the same horse- <br>
power and torque as when it was first broken in. The narrow, jackshaft-equipped <br>
four- cylinder engine is as smooth as ever and still feels tight and solid despite <br>
hard use. The engine inspires confidence on a long run.  <br>
Power is biased toward the upper end of the rev range. There is a noticeable <br>
surge in the powerband at 6,000 rpms the engine pulls quickly to red- line at <br>
9,500 rpm. That's not surprising for a double over- head camshaft design, but for <br>
a two-valves-per-cylinder engine it is a bit soft in the mid- range. The Seca lacks <br>
the roll- on pnnch of the Kawasaki KZ750 which uses a similar engine design. <br>
Idealiy, the power surge would come at lower revs and the final-drive gearing <br>
would be taller, to drop engine speed while cruising on the highway.  <br>
Transmission and clutch have proved bulletproof. There is some notchiness in <br>
finding neutral for which the shift linkage was suspect, but the stickiness was <br>
found to be internal. The clutch never slips under immoderate street use and has <br>
a smooth, easily controlled engagement point. The Seca 750 handled well when <br>
new <br>
and feels unchanged after 12,000 km. We mounted set of saddlebags and a <br>
topbox for the touring portion of the test and found the additions seriously <br>
affected handling. The pendulous mass of the loaded topbox lightened the front <br>
end to the detriment of stability when cornering or on straights. <br>
With a dry weight of 218 kg and a wheel- base of 1,445 mm, the Seca is lighter <br>
than some of its Glass rivals, most notably the Suzuki GS750 and Honda's Sabre <br>
and CB750F, but is close to Kawasaki's KZ750. <br>
The Seca offers a less than perfect ride over expansion joints on the highway and <br>
a choppy feeling on rougher roads. But it's nimble in turns and on twisting back- <br>
roads. The choppiness comes from the inability of the suspension to control fully <br>
the unsprung weight of front and rear wheel assemblies. <br>
There's a considerable weight around the front axle -- two large discs, calipers <br>
and the anti-dive mechanism. At the rear, a driveshaft and a differential housing <br>
with bevel gears add to the burden on the adjustable shocks. Still, ride quality <br>
was acceptable and the jacking effect that driveshafts traditionally have on motor- <br>
cycles minimal. <br>
The chassis is a strong one. The double- cradle steel frame is heavily braced <br>
around the steering head and triangulated behind the engine. The downtubes <br>
below the seat and the cradle tubes coming up behind the engine meet in welded <br>
steel circles for the swingarm/driveshaft housing pivot. <br>
The Seca won't flex when ridden hard thanks to the frame design and the front <br>
fork assembly. Sturdy 36 mm fork tubes are firmly held with six bolts on the triple <br>
clamps. <br>
While the Seca doesn't have a flexy frame, it does have a weight-distribution <br>
problem. Weight bias for the 218 kg motor- cycle is 44 per dent front and 56 per <br>
cent rear. That's 3 per cent less on the front end than either the Kawasaki KZ750, <br>
Honda CB750F or the Suzuki GS750EX. The stock tires aggravate the light front <br>
end. For a sporting 750 cc motorcycle, the tires are too narrow and the rubber <br>
compound too hard. When pushed hard in corners, marginal traction with stock <br>
rubber often unnerves the rider, forcing him to back off the pace or risk losing the <br>
front end. We would gladly trade off some tire life for better traction, especially at <br>
the front which after 12,000 km shows little sign of wear. The rear tire, though, is <br>
just about finished. <br>
There is no question that the anti-dive system works, but there is a price to be <br>
paid besides the unsprung weight and complication. It now is a chore to bleed the <br>
brake system. Four nipples have to be bled and the cable-operated master <br>
cylinder hidden below the top triple clamp makes it all but impossible to see fluid <br>
level or anything else. We have no complaints about brake feel or operation but <br>
then we didn't have any for the Seca 650 either, which had no anti-dive. <br>
 Computerized instrument panels are common now but when it first arrived last <br>
year, the Seca's instruments stunned observers. It remains unchanged for 1982. <br>
The central piece is a liquid crystal display that monitors seven separate functions <br>
and graphically indicates the fuel level. Sidestand, brake-fluid level, engine-oil <br>
level, battery-fluid level, head- light, taillight and fuel-warning LCDs light up in <br>
sequence within two seconds of the engines start, as the computer scans each <br>
electrical pickup for abnormal readings. <br>
A check button will make the computer cycle through the system but it isn't <br>
necessary as any malfunction automatically starts the warning light flashing while <br>
the appropriate LCD is illuminated. The flashing warning light can be a distraction, <br>
so an override button can either stop the light flashing on the first push or cancel <br>
it with another. <br>
The Cable-operated speedometer and electric tachometer suffered from the fit- <br>
ting of the LCD display. Both instruments should have bigger faces but the <br>
speedometer especially seems squeezed; too many little white Lines make quick <br>
reading of the speed difficult. <br>
Riders' reactions to the computer sys- tem varied. Some didn't mind it or worry <br>
about possible replacement (at a cost of approximately $550). Others found it <br>
overly complex and fragile -- more flash than function. Our test bike suffered no <br>
problems with the instruments despite powerwashings and plenty of exposure to <br>
the elements. <br>
A Yamaha dealer we talked with has had no Seca 750 in for instrument or <br>
computer problems either so it seems that it is durable, but since the bike has <br>
only been on the market for two years, extended lifespan is unknown. <br>
The computer system comes with restrictions and warnings for the protection of <br>
the delicate assembly. Wattage of light bulbs cannot be changed, extra electric <br>
accessories cannot be added to the computerized monitor system, the instrument <br>
panel must not be subject to splashing or steam from underneath (don't ford <br>
rivers with a hot engine), the display panel must not be pressed hard or given any <br>
shock and magnets or magnetized objects must not be put near the display <br>
panel. <br>
Despite the trick -- some would say ugly -- appearance of the headlight and small <br>
spotlight, lighting is inferior to a good round headlight like the Seca 650's. In the <br>
country on moonless nights, the beam from the rectangular headlight lacks <br>
definition and penetrating power. The spotlight helps to illuminate distant <br>
reflective road signs and the like but otherwise is ineffective. The spot is clear this <br>
year instead of amber as in 1981 because of some Canadian regional lighting <br>
regulations. The wrap-around taillight is attractive, bright and clearly visible from <br>
the side. <br>
Self-canceling turn signals are bright and work well. They can be cancelled by <br>
hand at any time or will self cancel after the motorcycle has traveled 150metres or <br>
for 10 seconds, whichever is greater. With the exception of the high/low beam <br>
switch, the controls are easy to operate and logically placed. The high/low switch <br>
is too far from the grip for easy manipulation and needs conscious thought to <br>
operate. Operation of the spotlight switch requires moving the right hand from a <br>
secure grip on the bar. <br>
The mirrors are among the best we have seen. One rider didn't like the <br>
rectangular shape but for most of the others shape was fine; the mirrors didn't <br>
blur and offered a wider range of visibility to the rear than conventional round <br>
mirrors. Seating position and comfort are good but not exceptional. The seat feels <br>
as stepped as it looks but for most riders it was comfortable even after a long <br>
ride. It curves down below the rider and spreads his weight over a wider contact <br>
area than a flatter seat would. The foot pegs are low enough that tall riders didn't <br>
feel that they were sitting on their feet. Knees can tuck in close to the engine <br>
below the narrow rear section of the fuel tank for warmth on a cool night. <br>
 The handlebar didn't make many friends, although because it is a real bar and <br>
not a pair of expensive forgings the owner can easily switch to a preferred shape. <br>
The stock bar is too wide and high and places the rider's torso directly into the <br>
wind. <br>
Passengers will like the Seca if they are of relatively short stature. The pegs are <br>
high in relation to the seat and require too much knee bending for taller riders to <br>
be comfortable. <br>
The Seca 750 rates highly as a safe motorcycle. Brakes are good, with a rear <br>
drum for instant response in the rain and discs that are easily controlled with a <br>
firm hand. Modulation of both brakes is excel- lent and accidental wheel locking <br>
never occurred. The horn is one of the loudest in motorcycling, a welcome sound <br>
after too many almost inaudible little horns. Tail and brake lights as well as turn <br>
signals are bright enough to alert near Sightless automobile drivers. <br>
Few riders found any vibration worth commenting on and then it was only the <br>
mildest sensation in the handgrips and footpegs at high engine speed. It is no <br>
worse than any parallel four-cylinder motorcycle and better than many. There <br>
were no squeaks or rattles from any part of the motorcycle. <br>
Not once did the Seca fail to start on the first try. Despite sitting out in a cold, <br>
hard Atlantic rain overnight, a flick of the choke and a push on the starter button <br>
got <br>
the fire going. The electrical charging sys- tem is top notch. The battery lost <br>
neither power nor fluid. Starting cold the choke is usually needed for less than a <br>
kilometre, .after which it can be shut off without causing carburation difficulties. <br>
Throttle response from the four Hitachi constant- velocity 32 mm carbs is beyond <br>
reproach. <br>
Tools for the Seca are typically of poor quality, but we never had anything break <br>
or go out of adjustment to require tools. changing the rear spring preload to suit <br>
riding conditions was the sole exception. A dealer tune-up during the test turned <br>
up two loose shims (the only engine adjustment required since break-in. The <br>
engine is a tough, trouble-free unit. <br>
A motorcycle needs more than styling and gimmickry to stand up to 12,000 km of <br>
hard use -- it needs substance. For motor- cyclists in the space age, the Seca <br>
750 is a solid, reliable performer -- anything but a flash in the pan. <br>
