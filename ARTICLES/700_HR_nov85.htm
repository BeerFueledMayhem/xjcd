            The 700-Class Performance Cruisers<br>
            Hot Rod Magazine - Nov 1985<br>
            by Dexter Ford<br>
            There used to be a clearly defined group of motorcycles called, for <br>
            lack of a better term, "standards." These were the bikes that could <br>
            function well in almost any street-riding mode, from long haul <br>
            touring to backroad rat-racing to urban trolling. They are mostly <br>
            gone now. The choice today in mid-size motorcycles is between <br>
            all-out road racers, ready for sticky tires and a trip to the race <br>
            course, and the bikes you see before you street-wise bikes with 4 <br>
            cylinders, flashy styling, more or less laidback riding positions, <br>
            and, we are discovering, a remarkable ability to do almost anything <br>
            a rider could want from them. The standard look (low, conservative <br>
            bars, muted style, and a comfortable seat) may be gone, but these <br>
            three shaft-driven inline fours from Japan are the heirs to the <br>
            class in terms of sheer versatility. <br>
            KAWASAKI ZN700 LTD<br>
            The LTD is the most cruiser-oriented machine of the three its high, <br>
            pullback bars and radically stepped seat force the rider into an <br>
            easy-chair position, and its aging, but very effective, DOHC <br>
            two-valve motor is the strongest of the bunch in terms of low-end <br>
            punch. Mid-range is good--but the two Maxims, from Yamaha, can eat <br>
            it up when all-out acceleration is the game. The motor is the <br>
            smoothest of the group, with its rubber mounting system, and the <br>
            chassis is quite competent, even for hard going on the backroads, <br>
            though a little less agile than its Yamaha brethren. If your idea of <br>
            the ideal machine is a mellow, nicely engineered city bike that lets <br>
            you loll back against the seat step and delivers velvety power from <br>
            the bottom of the tach dial, the $3149 LTD may be your choice.<br>
            YAMAHA XJ700 MAXIM<br>
            The Motorcyclist Magazine testers almost unanimously chose the <br>
            air-cooled, DOHC, two-valve Maxim as their favorite, day in and day <br>
            out, of the three. Its newer and more expensive sibling, the awesome <br>
            five-valve Maxim X, has more top-end power, and if racing for pinks <br>
            is the game, the Maxim X is going to be the outright winner. But on <br>
            the street, keeping the Maxim X's engine spinning up near its <br>
            10,000-rpm redline gets a bit tiring; the pros all preferred the <br>
            torquier, smoother, and slightly slower Maxim.<br>
            The chassis of the two Yamahas is almost identical; like the Kawie, <br>
            they're both shaft-drive 5-speeds, but both Maxims have much more <br>
            alert, upright riding positions. For most riding, from high-speed <br>
            rural outings to freeway cruising, the testers liked the erect <br>
            Yamaha setup better. The Maxims allow the rider to lean into the <br>
            wind on a highway--to keep from having to support the upper body by <br>
            pulling back on the bars all day; the lower, flatter handlebars also <br>
            help make the steering feel more immediate, and let the rider haul <br>
            his way forward to get extra traction at the front wheel when <br>
            cornering hard.<br>
            The engine is not new, but it works wonderfully; carburetion is <br>
            glitch-free, and there is always power at hand, from 1500 rpm to <br>
            redline. And most judged the Maxim's styling to be the best of the <br>
            group as well; the candy-red tank and tastefully applied brightwork <br>
            make the XJ a bike even a confirmed sport bike rider could love.<br>
            YAMAHA XJ700X MAXIM X<br>
            Yamaha broke new ground this year with the FZ750, a very serious <br>
            sport bike with a radical five-valve-per-cylinder, DOHC head. Very <br>
            simply, the FZ makes more power than any 750 has ever made before, <br>
            and all with impeccable low-end and mid-range. The Maxim X has the <br>
            cruiser version of that motor; the bottom end is substantially <br>
            different, but the business end--that wonderful five-valve head--is <br>
            identical.<br>
            And the thing moves like the technology leader it is. When the tach <br>
            needle winds past 7500 rpm the bike takes off like an F-14 from the <br>
            deck of the Hornet. Yamaha's V-Max, the 1200cc, V-4-powered monster <br>
            that's now the most powerful bike available over the counter, now <br>
            has a little brother in the stop-light wars.<br>
            For confirmed speed freaks the Maxim X is a standout, but a couple <br>
            of flies stray into the adulation ointment. The carburetion is not <br>
            great at low speeds; trying to open the throttle smoothly from idle <br>
            gets you a substantial lurch, no matter how gentle you are. And the <br>
            power is impressive only at the top end; both the Kawasaki and the <br>
            two-valve Maxim were faster in our roll-on race from 50 mph in top <br>
            gear. The liquid-cooled, high-tech motor is a jewel, but you can get <br>
            more tasteful styling, easier-to-use power, and the same chassis in <br>
            the plainer Maxim, and for $500 less.<br>
            Whichever you choose, the 700 cruisers will be giving you fast, <br>
            low-maintenance transportation--and with all the style you'll need <br>
            to turn heads.<br>
             <br>
