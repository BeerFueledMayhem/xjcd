<font face="Times New Roman" class="fsx05" color="#000000">Warm up then engine before changing the oil.<br>
<br>
Center stand it on a level surface.<br>
<br>
Use a 6 pt socket to remove the oil filter bolt.  Chances are it was put on <br>
too tight, so any other tool with just round it.  There is a gap between <br>
the inner 2 headers and it's a bit tight pulling the housing off with the <br>
bolt.  Don't pull the bolt off.  You might be one of the few that still has <br>
the washer and I'd imagine this is how they get lost.<br>
<br>
Of course if you do the filter housing first, the drain pan will be empty <br>
and make it easy to find the washer and spring.<br>
<br>
The drain plug is a few inches below the filter housing and is easy to spot <br>
with the Phillips screw head.  I use about 10 inches of extentions (6" & <br>
4") to avoid hitting the pipes.  Gloves are a good idea.<br>
<br>
Not the end of the drain plug.  It is magnetic.  Clean it real good and <br>
note the amount of material on it.  Does give an idea of wear and if <br>
something might be wrong.  Install the plug and torque it to 31 ft lbs.<br>
<br>
There are 2 o-rings for the filter housing.  One fits over the bolt and one <br>
is for where the housing mates with the engine block, which should be wiped <br>
clean.  Compare the o-rings with the new ones (that should come with the <br>
filter).  Sometimes they are too small and might leak, re-use the old ones <br>
if that is the case.  Provided they are in good condition.  Coat them with <br>
white lithium grease.  New engine oil is good too, just don't install them <br>
dry.  With grease, the housing o-ring will stay put.<br>
<br>
The ordering is bolt into the housing, spring, washer (if you still have <br>
one), and the filter, which should be the recessed side.  Some grease or <br>
oil on the rubber bits is a good idea.<br>
<br>
When you were removing the housing note the top part by the mating surface <br>
has a tang, which fits into the gap between two bosses on the block.  It <br>
can be lined up first, pushed in place, and held or spin the bolt on first <br>
and wait for the tang to catch, then back off a little and line it <br>
up.  Pushing it down first does make it easier to start the bolt, but <br>
either way works.  The housing bolt is tightened to only 11 ft lbs, which <br>
is not much.  The seals are there to prevent leaking.  Consider either <br>
anti-size or grease on the bolt threads.  Most of the anti-seize or all of <br>
the grease will wash away over time, but it's much easier to remove the <br>
bolt next time around.  Not to mention easier to turn and that means 11 ft <br>
lbs will seal leak free.<br>
<br>
The sight glass is on the right hand side, as is the fill hole (about mid <br>
shin).  Capacity is 3 US qt (2.5 Imperial qts or 2.8 litre).  Fill it until <br>
the oil is either gone or the level is 2/3 the way from the bottom of the <br>
sight glass.  Put the fill plug back on, start the engine, run for about a <br>
minute, wait about a minute and re-check the level.  Add until the oil is <br>
about 1/2 to 2/3 the way from the bottom of the sight glass.<br>
<br>
Then put on 3000 miles as soon as you can to change it again.  Repeat many <br>
times for years of enjoyment.  Oh, the manual says to change the filter <br>
every *other* change.  Sod that, change it every time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Final gear oil should be done after a 20 mile ride to warm the housing <br>
up.  Drain plug is on the bottom and fill plug is at an angle mid-rear of <br>
the housing (the top "plug" is a breather).  The drain plug also has a <br>
magnet to clean and inspect.  The torque spec is 17 ft lbs and is filled to <br>
the top of the fill hole's threads.  One US qt or Imp. qt or litre will be <br>
good for about 5 changes.  Interval is 15, 000 miles or 24 months.  Many <br>
here do it yearly.  Mine has been done every other oil change.  Now that <br>
I've changed to semi-synthetic (eventually a full synthetic) that could be <br>
extended.  Figure with the small amount it's rather cheap.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John already mentioned the 3 drain bolts for cooling (all on the right <br>
side).  Torque spec is 11 ft lbs for them.  Mix should be 50/50 and don't <br>
think that going to a higher percentage coolant mix is better due to higher <br>
boiling point.  Water has a greater heat capacity than ethylene glycol and <br>
using less water will reduce the total heat capacity of the cooling <br>
system.  Needs about 2.5 US qt (2.11 Imp qt or 2.4 litre) total.  Manual <br>
says soft water is OK, but distilled water is better.<br>
<br>
The system can be flushed, just like with a car.  Use the same stuff, only <br>
about 1/4 to 1/2 what you need.  A bit rich, but it's only temporary.  DO <br>
NOT install the cap when flushing.  Drain, add the flush, and fill with tap <br>
water.  Just don't fill it too full.  As is, it might overflow.  Run for <br>
about 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
This is also a good time to check the cooling fan operation.  It should <br>
come on right about when the gauge reaches the red mark.  Might be after, <br>
but gauge operation varies.<br>
<br>
Rather than allowing the cleaning mix too cool after turning the engine <br>
off, drain some into the reservoir to clean it up first, then flush the <br>
system with tap water.  This will cool it off and you can add the 50/50 <br>
mix, start the engine, run it until the gauge is at the middle and add mix <br>
to the reservoir to about 3/4 the way to the "full" mark.<br>
<br>
Flushing the system yearly, as well as using distilled water with a coolant <br>
that contains no silicates will extend the life of the entire cooling system.<br>
<br>
Idle the engine from time to time and ensure that fan works, else you might <br>
be in a jam and overheat.  Came close last year due the fan being a slow <br>
starter.  An override switch to run it periodically or in case the sensor <br>
goes out is a good idea.<br>
