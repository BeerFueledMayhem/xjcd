<font face="Arial" class="fsx06">On October 8, 2004 the XJ world lost one of our own. 35 years young, Jeff Mountin died suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack in his home. <br>
<br>
Jeff was a fixture in our world. An &quot;Original Owner&quot; as he would describe himself, he found his 1985 XJ750XN MaximX new. It had been sitting neglected in the showroom, a dusty gem that Jeff recognized as the treasure it was years before others called them 'classics'. <br>
<br>
Jeff was a very early member of the XJ Owner's mailing list group and in 2000 he stepped up to the plate as the new &quot;listowner&quot;. For the next 4 years he served to administer the technical details, help subscribers with e-mail problems, politely quell the unruly and offer help to all who asked. <br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06">On news of his death, tributes poured in from all over the world. Nils Tangedal sums up how we all feel:<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06">&quot;I believe all members of this group are as stunned and saddened as can be. &nbsp;</font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06">Mountin</font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06"> Man was unique in knowledge and helpfulness. &nbsp;They must have broken the mold after he was cast, because there sure aren't many around to equal Jeff's competence and understanding of complex issues.<br>
<br>
During my time on this list I have grown very fond of </font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06">Mountin</font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06"> Man and I have succeeded when following his advice. &nbsp;For that and his personal style and kindness I will be forever grateful. &nbsp;One important character trait is as List-Owner, he never put anyone down &nbsp;without bringing them back up. Whenever he was sarcastic in his comments, it was always with a smile. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
He was a man of warmth and compassion. Jeff </font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06">Mountin</font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06"> was truly one-of-a-kind and his presence will be sorely missed. His memory will always be with us. &nbsp;And we will have to work hard to live up to his standards.&quot;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" class="fsx06">This edition of the XJCD is dedicated to his memory. &nbsp;Godspeed, Jeff, and thanks.<br>

<font face="Arial" class="fsx05">&quot;I cannot abide even the thought of severe restrictions on my mobility. Can cite all those that worked hard with their hands and after retiring or ending up in a home that didn't last much longer than that. Almost the same as some stuff I saw on welding talking about fumes and one person wondered how the blacksmith in a barn lived to 80, smoked, chewed, drank, and only died after having to retire from the work he loved. Quality of life and I have been growing my hair out a bit more, so like the wind in it. Makes a good scarf too. ;)<br>

Take Care!<br>
