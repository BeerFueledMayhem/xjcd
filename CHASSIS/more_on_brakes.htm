<font face="Times New Roman" class="fsx05" color="#000000">Hydraulic disc brakes are quite common now. Before Honda came out with the CB750 <br>
in 1969 you didn't see them much, now they are everywhere, even on clutches. <br>
They work very good and are quite reliable, but are often neglected. No one <br>
thinks about them until they don't work, then they think about them alot ! <br>
Usually you go out to ride in the spring, pull the lever to stop and the brakes <br>
don't work, lock up, drag, or feel spongy. Other times the brakes worked OK, <br>
then you put a new set of pads on and the pistons won't go back in the caliper. <br>
Other times they do, but then drag when the brakes are applied. The cause is <br>
poor or no maintenance. Brake fluid loves water and when water gets in so does <br>
gook and rust. The cure can be somewhat easy or an all day affair.<br>
Put the bike on its center stand and remove the brake caliper from the disk. <br>
Usually two bolts hold it in position on the front wheel and the rear wheel. <br>
Alot of times it is easier, on the Rear Wheel, to take the axle out and pull out <br>
the whole mounting bracket. Position the handlebars so the master cylinder is <br>
level and take a large, wet, towel and put it over the gas tank and any painted <br>
surface. Brake fluid will ruin a painted surface. Take off brake fluid reservoir <br>
cover and make sure it is filled with fluid. After removing the brake pads, pump <br>
the brake lever once while watching the caliper piston. You will see the piston <br>
move out just a bit. Put a bowl under the caliper and keep pumping until the <br>
piston pops out. Keep an eye on the reservoir and add brake fluid as needed. If <br>
there is more than one piston, let one move out a bit then put a C-clamp on it <br>
to keep it from moving out any further and keep pumping... the other piston will <br>
now move out. Alternate the C-clamp between the pistons so they move out of the <br>
caliper together equally, until they can be removed.<br>
When the piston pops out, look inside the caliper and you will see the round, <br>
square sectioned O-ring. Remove it from its groove and clean everything in clean <br>
brake fluid. I use brake fluid because if you use solvents you must make sure <br>
you get any residue cleaned out. If you don't, it could contaminate the new <br>
brake fluid and O-ring. Remember, it's your life at stake here. <br>
<br>
<br>
Use new parts and/or rebuild kits.<br>
<br>
On older bikes you may have to clean and reuse old parts. If the piston has any <br>
marks or pits in it, <br>
<br>
<br>
GET A NEW ONE.<br>
Reassemble the caliper using only brake fluid for lubrication. Use your shop <br>
manual to aid in assembly... You do have one, don't you ? <br>
With the entire system drained of old brake fluid, bolt everything back <br>
together. <br>
Now comes the fun part ! <br>
 Fill the master cylinder fluid reservoir with new brake fluid of the right <br>
type. ( DOT 3, DOT 4, Dot 5 ) Put a hose, of the right size, on the bleed screw <br>
and put the end in a jar. Pump the brake handle or pedal several times and then <br>
hold it on. Open the bleed screw, on the caliper, and fluid mixed with air will <br>
come out. Close the screw, pump it up again and repeat the process. Keep it up <br>
until you have a firm feel to the lever and no air in the brake fluid coming <br>
out. Lastly hose everything off with water to remove any trace of brake fluid.<br>
Sounds so easy... Yes ? It can be, if all the parts are new. Unfortunately, by <br>
the time I see these things they are pretty far gone. If you were to replace <br>
everything... caliper(s), master cyl., hoses...you could easily lay out $500 or <br>
more. Because of this we end up using alot of old parts, which is OK if we keep <br>
it within reason.<br>
So, you pump and you pump... nothing. Now what ? <br>
Try bleeding the air from every fitting  on the hose, such as where the hose <br>
attaches to the master cyl. and anywhere else that there is a fitting. <br>
Try filling the system from the bleeder screw with an air pump and bleeder jar. <br>
Tap the fittings lightly with a hammer to jar the air bubbles loose. <br>
Let things set overnight, then do everything over again. <br>
Be patient, keep bleeding the system... this may take quite a while. Even after <br>
lots of effort, the brakes can feel spongy. This can be from old brake lines <br>
which are expanding just a bit. The cure is new lines. <br>
The hydraulic clutch is handled in the same way.<br>
