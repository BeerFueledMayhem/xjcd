      A major tip o' the hat to <A href="mailto:net1plus.com@holbrook">Mark 
      Holbrook</A>, who taught me just about everything I know about changing 
      motorcycle tires. (Mark and I don't agree on all of the points discussed 
      in our respective tire changing manifestos, so make sure to check out <A 
      href="./motorcycletirechanging.htm#read">the 
      section on "additional reading"</A> where there are links to Mark's take 
      on the subject.) Additional suggestions and assistance provided by <A

      There are lots of different kinds of bikes with lots of different 
      configurations. Rather than try to be correct for 100% of the bikes out 
      there, I'll just tell you what I do when I change <U>my</U> tires, which 
      (as you'll see) spend most of their time wrapped around the wheels of a 
      1998 CBR900RR. Your bike may be wildly different, but many of the steps 
      will be similar; more on this in <A 
      href="./motorcycletirechanging.htm#0">"step 
      zero"</A>. <BR><BR>Oh, and those of you with single-sided swingarms 
      (Ducatis, Triumphs, etc.) ... I bet you thought that single sided 
      swingarms were pretty cool, huh? Well, not when it comes to tire changes. 
      You won't be able to put the wheel on the balancer shown in this document, 
      nor will you be able to use the wall-pivoted bead breaker without a helper 
      to hold the wheel on the stand. But unless you plan to do without 
      balancing (not recommended!), you'll either need to make a jig that'll let 
      you slide a 5/8" threaded rod through the center of the rim, or you'll 
      need to take the bike to an Authorized Dealer for your marque to get your 
      tires balanced. It's OK; the rest of us won't laugh at you.

      <HR noShade SIZE=2 width="100%">
      This document describes a method of changing so-called "tubeless" tires. 
      Once upon a time, tires had inner tubes that held the air pressure 
      required to keep tires rigid and support the weight of the vehicle. This 
      was necessary back when wheels had spokes which necessitated many holes in 
      the rim; now that most vehicles don't have spoked wheels, it's possible to 
      get rid of the inner tube all together and simply have the tire itself 
      hold the air. This makes life easier for a number of reasons, and is 
      generally regarded as a Good Thing. Indeed, you're fairly unlikely to run 
      across tube tires (tires that require inner tubes) unless you're working 
      on dirt bikes (which need spoked wheels for flexibility and light weight) 
      or cruisers (which seem to eschew any technology from the last five 
      decades in the name of "style.") Oops, am I showing my bias? Let's just 
      move right along... <BR><BR>Anyway, the document you're reading now is a 
      description of a method for changing the more common 
      tube<STRONG>less</STRONG> tires. But I know there will be folks interested 
      in the steps required to change tube tires, so I wrote <A 
      href="http://www.clarity.net/~adam/tire-changing-dirt.html">a little 
      addendum</A> on how to do that. Much of this information is still 
      applicable, but you won't need nearly as much hardware for changing tube 
      tires -- a milk crate to hold the wheel and a couple of tire irons should 
      do the trick. <BR><BR>If this is your first time, let's review a little 
      terminology. I refer you to some pictures I 
      took:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <A

      Station: Parts</STRONG><BR>
      <HR noShade SIZE=2 width="100%">
      Unless you've got spoked wheels and tube tires, you're going to want to 
      build a tire changing station. But if you've already got one, <A 
      href="./motorcycletirechanging.htm#3">skip ahead to 
      step three.</A> <BR><BR>Get the parts and accessories you'll need to build 
      the tire changing station. The parts are all available cheap -- except for 
      the shop press (which is optional!) you can probably buy all of this stuff 
      for under $30. You'll need: 
      <UL>
        <LI><A 
        href="./carwheel.jpg">An 
        old steel 14" car wheel</A> -- available at your local junk yard. You 
        shouldn't have to spend more than $10 -- call around. Once you get it, 
        wash/scrub all the dirt, rust, and brake dust off, then let it dry. 
        (When mounting it to the workbench, the open end goes up, as you can see 
        in <A 
        href="./carwheel.jpg">this 
        picture</A>.) Wrap 3-4 layers' worth of duct tape around the top and a 
        layer or two around the bottom. Unless you've discovered a magical brand 
        of stretchy duct tape, you'll probably want to do this in multiple short 
        overlapping strips, otherwise the duct tape tends to pull away from the 
        wheel. (You can also use a split garden hose the length of the 
        circumference of the car wheel. Glue or tape it down to the rim, or 
        drill holes in the car rim and hold it in place with zip-ties.) 
        <BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> a 14" car wheel works great for the 16" and 
        17" wheels on my motorcycles. If you have large brake rotors, 18" 
        wheels, or other strange things, you may need to make your stand from a 
        different size of car wheel. The most important factor to consider is 
        that the stand must not damage your bike wheel. So measure and be 
        careful with the bike wheel's brake rotors, and make sure you pad the 
        car wheel well so it won't scrape the bike wheel's paint. 
        <LI>A bead-breaking apparatus. You can either use <A 
        href="./mbardown.jpg">a 
        large 2x4" lever</A> that pivots at a nearby wall (more on this in <A 
        href="./motorcycletirechanging.htm#2">step 
        two</A>), or some other method. <A 
        href="http://www.harborfreight.com/">Harbor Freight Tools</A> sells a <A 
        href="http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/taf/DisplayItem.taf?ItemNumber=33497">12-ton 
        hydraulic press</A> which can make the job muuuuch easier. Ok, 
        admittedly, their stuff isn't really high quality -- but for $120 
        <EM>delivered</EM>, it seems like a steal. And it's good for other 
        stuff, too. You'll see me using it in the pictures below. You can also 
        use <A 
        href="./cclamp.jpg">C-clamps</A> 
        or car jacks or a variety of other tools to break beads ... use your 
        imagination, and be careful. 
        <LI><A 
        href="./rodacc.jpg">A 
        5/8" threaded rod</A>, 2' long, plus three nuts and three washers. <A 
        href="http://www.homedepot.com/">Home Depot</A> sells threaded rods 
        pre-cut to 2', plus the 5/8" coarse nuts, the 5/8" washers, etc. 
        <LI><A 
        href="./rodacc.jpg">Some 
        plywood blocks</A>, about 4x4", with 5/8" holes cut in the center. 
        Self-explanatory. Easy to make from scrap pieces left over from other 
        projects. 
        <LI>A 5/8" hole in your workbench, centered on the axis of the steel 
        wheel, wherever it is that you decide to build this monstrosity. If 
        you're building a wall-mounted bead breaker (the long 2x4" method, as 
        described in <A 
        href="./motorcycletirechanging.htm#2">step 
        two</A>, below), the location of the tire changing station will also be 
        determined by where you can put the pivot for the bead breaker. 
        <LI><A href="balance2.jpg">A balancing 
        stand</A> -- sometimes as simple as <A 
        href="./woodstand.jpg">scrap 
        wood</A> or two stacks of bricks, sometimes as custom-built as <A 
        href="http://www.spec2.com/shop.html#wheel">a commercial product</A>. 
        There are lots of options here, and they're discussed in exhausting 
        detail in <A

      Bead Breaker</STRONG><BR>
      <HR noShade SIZE=2 width="100%">
      If you're using a hydraulic shop press to break the beads, you can mostly 
      skip this step. Mount the car wheel to the workbench and hold it down with 
      the threaded rod, plywood blocks, washers, and 5/8" nuts. The bottom will 
      probably look <A 
      href="./assmbot.jpg">like 
      this</A>, and the top will look <A 
      href="./assmtop.jpg">like 
      this</A>. You're all ready to go. Skip ahead to <A 
      href="./motorcycletirechanging.htm#3">step 
      three</A>. For those of you going the 2x4" bead breaker route, <EM>some 
      assembly required</EM> ... 
      <UL>
        <LI>You need to generate a lot of force to break the bead, so make a 
        long 2x4" bar (the "Maloney bar"), maybe 6' long or so. Round one end 
        and drill a 5/8" hole in it, and pick up a 6" long 5/8" bolt (and nut, 
        and washers) at your local hardware store. Just <A 
        href="./pivotpoint.jpg">like 
        these</A>. 
        <LI>If you have exposed studs on your garage walls ... uh.. hey, stop 
        laughing -- I'm trying to teach you something here you little monkeys. 
        If you have exposed studs that you don't mind drilling a 5/8" hole 
        through, you can use one as a pivot point. My garage has plywood walls, 
        so I had to <A 
        href="./wallpivot.jpg">bolt 
        some 2x4"s to the wall</A> to use as a pivot. Mine ended up looking <A 
        href="./maloneybar.jpg">like 
        this</A>. 
        <LI>Attach <A 
        href="./ram.jpg">a 
        short "ram"</A> to the lever, preferably on a pivot of its own (to make 
        it more adjustable), at a point where you can use it to apply much force 
        to the sidewall of the tire. When assembled, the bead breaker might look 
        <A 
        href="./mbarassy.jpg">something 
        like this</A>. Make sure your ram is long enough to push the sidewall 
        <U>way</U> down -- otherwise you'll be unpleasantly surprised at how far 
        down you can push the sidewall down before the bead releases. When 
        you're trying to break the bead, make sure you're pushing on the 
        sidewall right next to the rim. Something <A 
        href="./where2push.jpg">like 
        this</A>. 
        <LI>Once you've got your bead breaker assembled and the car wheel 
        mounted to your workbench, you're ready to proceed. </LI></UL></TD></TR>

      You'll also want the following accessories when you do the tire change, so 
      if you're going out shopping, don't forget to pick up: 
      <UL>
        <LI><A 
        href="./rimprot.jpg">Three 
        tire irons</A> -- I like <A 
        href="http://www.motionpro.com/Docs/tiretools.html">the curved ones</A> 
        that <A href="http://www.motionpro.com/">Motion Pro</A> makes, but you 
        can use any ones you want. It sometimes helps to have a really long one 
        (2' or more), particularly if you won't have a helper available. You'll 
        see. (In his otherwise <A 
        href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0760302294/usedmotorcycleev/">lovely 
        book</A>, <A 
        href="./kc.jpg">Kevin 
        Cameron says</A> that you should never use a tire iron longer than your 
        hand. As he points out, it's true that you can break stuff if you apply 
        too much force, but that's a failure of technique rather than tools. You 
        will be excused if you don't listen to the esteemed Mr. Cameron on this 
        one issue, particularly if you don't have magnesium or carbon-fiber 
        wheels.) 
        <LI><A 
        href="./rimprot.jpg">Rim 
        protectors</A> -- you can buy them, but I've found that the best 
        solution to protecting the rims is to cut the sides off of old #2 HDPE 
        shampoo bottles or water bottles. (Preferably empty ones.) These HDPE 
        strips can fit into places that the commercial rim protectors can't, 
        plus they're often easier to pull out. (Losing a rim protector in the 
        tire will <EM>totally</EM> throw off the balancing...) To combat that, 
        some people like to tape (or otherwise attach) the rim protectors to 
        their tire irons. I've never felt a need to, mostly because I used the 
        homemade HDPE strips instead of <A 
        href="./thickrimprot.jpg">the 
        commercial rim protectors</A>. Experiment and develop your own 
        preference -- I've found that it's good to have both kinds. 
        <LI>A <A 
        href="./valvecore.jpg">valve 
        core tool</A> -- you can get these at any auto parts store. They're 
        cheap. 
        <LI>An <A 
        href="./aircomp.jpg">air 
        compressor</A> + <A 
        href="./airchuck.jpg">accessories</A> 
        -- you don't <U>need</U> an air compressor, but it'll save you from 
        having to make frequent trips to the local gas station. When I say 
        "accessories", I mean stuff like a tire chuck, air hose, etc. You might 
        be able to get away with a portable air tank (available at <A 
        href="http://www.sears.com/">Sears</A> or <A 
        href="http://www.homedepot.com/">The Home Depot</A>) in place of the air 
        compressor, though you'll still need to visit the gas station once to 
        fill the thing up. 
        <LI>Soapy water + sponge -- because you'll want to make the bead all 
        slippery when you're trying to wrassle it over the rim. An alternative 
        is commercial tire-changing lubricant, which has the advantage of 
        becoming tacky when it dries, helping the tire to stick to the rim. I 
        suppose you could try making your own tire-changing lubricant by 
        diluting some hair spray, but I'd be worried about possible chemical 
        damage to the rubber. I tend to use a spray bottle instead of a sponge, 
        but that makes it easy to put too much lubricant on, so unless you know 
        what you're doing, start with a wet-but-not-dripping sponge. 
        <LI><A 
        href="./weights.jpg">Wheel 
        weights + tape</A> -- for the balancing process. Unless you have the 
        right sort of clip-on weights for your rims, you'll need tape. "Tape" 
        means some double-sided <U>foam</U> tape for the underside of the wheel 
        weights (look for Scotch/3M Heavy Duty Mounting Tape at your local 
        hardware store), and some duct tape of the same color as your rims (when 
        they're clean) to put over the weights. 
        <LI>Chalk or <A 
        href="./tiremarker.jpg">a 
        crayon</A> or a pencil or something -- so you can mark the rims with the 
        direction of rotation. Otherwise (particularly on front wheels), it's 
        really easy to forget. Never ever ever mark the friction material of the 
        brake rotors. 
        <LI>A helper -- otherwise, when you're halfway through the installation 
        process, you'll wish you had an extra set of hands to hold the first two 
        tire irons while you're digging the third one in there. Up until the 
        remounting of the tire, you should be fine, but it'll make installation 
        <EM>so</EM> much easier with an extra set of hands around. 
        <LI>A ratcheting tie-down strap -- you may need one to flatten out the 
        tire's profile as you try to seat the bead. <BR>Last and definitely not 
        least: 
        <LI>Safety goggles -- you've only got two eyes, medical science can't 
        replace them for you, and -- ladies, look away for a moment -- we all 
        know that chicks <EM>don't</EM> really dig scars. So protect your eyes!! 
        It's probably a good idea to wear them the whole time; you never know 
        when a valve core or tire iron is going to go flying across the room. 
        Having and wearing safety goggles is essential! </LI></UL>I would be 
      remiss if I didn't mention that it helps to have new tires. So if you 
      don't already have them, go and get some now, Einstein. <BR><BR>If your 
      tire changing station is all set up and ready to go, and you've got the 
      tires, it's time for step four.

      Mark the rim or rotor carrier (not the rotor itself!) with chalk or pencil 
      to indicate the direction of rotation. Some rotors and rims (including 
      mine) have this cast into them, but if yours don't, make sure you note it 
      down. Unless you can figure it out because there's a speedometer pickup on 
      one side, or a rotor only on one side or something, you'll need to mark 
      the rims so when it comes time for installation, you put the tire back on 
      with the correct orientation. If you can't figure out the direction of 
      rotation from looking at the rim, but you <U>do</U> trust whoever did your

      It can be very hard to get the wheel far enough into the press to get the

      course, but on the sidewall as close to the rim as possible. If you can't 
      get the wheel in far enough to do this, the only real solution to this 
      (aside from getting a shop press with <A

      distance between the side supports</A>) is to bolt the press to the floor 
      and push the wheel forward (into the press) while you use the use the

      air in it) and lets the wheel move closer to where you want it. But, 
      really ... the bigger-shop-press solution is a lot safer. Pushing on the 
      press is a good way for it to fall over and crush stuff. And to hurt

      the bead removal job harder. Trust me. Don't tilt the wheel in an attempt

    </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2 vAlign=center>Tires last longer (and will provide marginally 
      more traction) if they are balanced. "Balanced" means that spinning the 
      wheel doesn't cause the axle to want to move off-axis. You'll only get 
      this condition if any heavy spots on the wheel are balanced with a little 
      added weight on the opposite side (180 degrees around) to cancel it out. 
      <BR><BR>Traditionally, the valve stem is thought of as the heaviest point 
      on the rim. So tire manufacturers mark the lightest point of each tire 
      (usually with <A 
      href="./paintswall.jpg">a 
      paint spot on the sidewall</A>), and you're supposed to line the paint 
      spot up with the valve stem. Except that the valve stem <EM>isn't</EM> 
      always the heaviest spot on the wheel. So it behooves you to put the wheel 
      on some balance stands and find its <EM>true</EM> heavy spot. Once you do, 
      you line the marked light spot of the new tire up with the heavy spot on 
      the rim. By lining the light spot of the tire up with the <EM>actual</EM> 
      heavy point on the rim, you often need less taped-on weight to balance the 
      wheel -- and sometimes none at all. (Note: we're not adding weight to the 
      wheel yet -- that'll come in <A 
      href="./motorcycletirechanging.htm#8">step 8</A> -- 
      right now we're just finding its heavy spot.) <BR><BR>Remove the old wheel 
      weights, and clean off any residual tape and adhesive remnants with a 
      cleaner that won't damage the paint. To be perfectly correct, you should 
      probably put the valve core back in and the valve cap back on, so go ahead 
      and do that. For rear wheels, you don't need to remove the sprocket 
      carrier/cush drive, or any of the rubber dampers, though if you have it's 
      probably OK. If your rear wheel's cush drive has a bearing that helps hold 
      the wheel on-axis, you may want to have the cush drive on when you balance 
      the rear wheel. Just make sure that if you need it, you put everything 
      back ... a single missing rubber bit from the cush drive will throw the 
      balance off completely. <BR><BR>Slide the axle (or threaded rod) through 
      the wheel bearings, and put the wheel on the balance stand. The balance 
      stand I use isn't much -- just <A 
      href="./woodstand.jpg">some 
      4x4"s with 2x4" bases</A>. A friend of mine uses stacks of bricks. If your 
      wheel bearings are in good shape, this will work fine. And if they aren't, 
      get new ones. <U>Hint</U>: if you can, do your balancing without the axle 
      spacers installed -- the wheel will spin more freely. Why is that a good 
      thing? Well, the more freely your wheel spins, the more accurate a 
      balancing job you can do -- make sure the wheel spins freely during 
      balancing! <BR><BR>If your bearings have enough drag that the wheel just 
      won't spin freely (or keeps trying to roll the whole assembly off the 
      stand!), you might still be able to use a balancer like the one pictured 
      below if you go to a bearing store, buy four ~1.5" OD bearings (without 
      grease), and screw them to the insides of the balance stand such that they 
      can rotate and cradle the axle (or the threaded rod) without letting it 
      rub against the wooden stand. If you do this, <A 
      href="./bearingart.jpg">draw 
      some diagrams</A> and measure things carefully before you try to set it 
      up. Or you could buy <A 
      href="./vblocks.jpg">some 
      V-blocks</A> and <A 
      href="./onvblocksqtr.jpg">hold 
      the axle/threaded-rod in place</A> that way. Or you could nail a long nail 
      on both sides of the axle (on both sides of the top of the stands) to 
      prevent the axle from falling off. If you can't get a stand-up balancer to 
      work, find a place where you can set up two parallel, straight, and level 
      2x4"s, and use those to hold each end of the axle up. Then it's OK for the 
      wheel to roll around a bit -- just make sure the 2x4"s are really 
      parallel, reasonably straight/unwarped, and 100% perfectly level. (Two 
      sawhorses, maybe?) You can also drive a nail into the top of the 4x4"s on 
      either side of the axle (on both 4x4"s) to hold the axle in place. Or if 
      you have them and can keep them from falling over, you could also use two 
      3' aluminum carpenter's levels. (A metal surface will let the axle roll 
      more freely -- better balancing.) You may be able make the parallel 2x4"s 
      or aluminum levels more stable with C-clamps holding them down against a 
      workbench or table. If you can't seem to make any of this work, you can 
      always buy something like the $140 <A 
      href="http://www.spec2.com/shop.html#wheel">Weigl-Telefix Wheel Balancer 
      Stand</A>. <BR><BR>If you make a wooden stand, consider putting <A 
      href="./notchhere.jpg">notches 
      on both sides</A> of the top. Why? Two reasons: 1) This will discourage 
      the wheel from rolling off the stand, and 2) This will keep the axle 
      stationary, giving you a chance to do runout inspections on the wheel with 
      a dial indicator. Which is a good thing to do as long as you have the 
      wheel off. If you can't cut notches in your balancing stand, buy <A 
      href="./vblocks.jpg">some 
      V-blocks</A> and <A 
      href="./onvblocksctr.jpg">use 
      them to cradle the axle or threaded rod</A> while you <A 
      href="./goodrunout.jpg">measure 
      radial runout</A>. Mine cost all of $6 at a used tool store. 
      (Incidentally, don't try to <A 
      href="./badrunout.jpg">measure 
      axial runout</A>, since, unless you can prevent the wheel from sliding on 
      the axle or threaded rod, you won't get reliable measurements. Measure 
      axial runout when the wheel is back on the bike.) Your bike's service 
      manual will be able to tell you how much runout is too much. </TD></TR>

      While you have the wheel off the bike and the tire off the wheel, it's

      clean them up a bit. <BR><BR>Also, wipe off any excess soapy water or tire

      Spin the wheel slowly (being careful not to let it fall off the stand) and 
      see where it stops. Mark the wheel at its lowest point -- 6-o'clock. Spin 
      it a bit more and see if it consistently stops at that point. If a point 
      on the rim spins past 6-o'clock (the lowest possible point) and the wheel 
      slows and changes direction so that the point swings back to 6-o'clock, 
      you've probably found the heavy spot. (The heavy spot will always try to 
      work its way to the 6-o'clock position.) Once you find the heavy spot, 
      mark it. You'll want to line the light point of the tire up with this 
      heavy spot. If the wheel always stops at different points and doesn't seem 
      to have a preference about which point ends up down, that's fine -- 
      assuming that the wheel is spinning freely and isn't stopping randomly due 
      to excessive friction, this just means there <EM>is</EM> no heavy spot on 
      your rim. When the time comes, you can put the light spot on the tire 
      anywhere. <BR><BR>On the plus side, the wheel's heavy spot shouldn't ever 
      change, so mark the heavy spot in a way that you'll be able to find it 
      next time. You should still check for the heavy spot each time, but you'll 
      be more certain that you've found the heavy spot if it seems to be the 
      same as it was the last time.

      Another technique that I had recommended to me (thanks, Bob!) was to put 
      the tire on a stand as described above, but instead of spinning the 
      <EM>wheel</EM> to find the heavy spot, you rotate the <EM>axle</EM> back 
      and forth. Huh? Here's how it works. You hold one side of the axle 
      stationary on the stand such that it won't fall off, but can be rotated on 
      its axis. The nails-on-either-side-of-the-axle trick would work well here, 
      as would using V-blocks if you hold the V-block with your hand. Then you 
      grab the other end of the axle and <A 
      href="./rotaxle.jpg">rotate 
      it back and forth</A>. This should be enough to overcome the friction in 
      the wheel bearings, and the heavy spot should drop to the bottom. Some 
      axles have <A 
      href="./holeinaxle.jpg">a 
      hole on one end</A> which might make spinning the axle easier -- slip a

      mind that you need to mount the tire in the right direction, so also look 
      at the rotation direction mark that you made earlier, and the rotation 
      direction mark on the sidewall. You may need to flip the tire over to get 
      the rotation direction right -- keep the heavy and light marks lined up if 
      you do so. <BR><BR>Get the lower sidewall and bead soaped up, and prepare 
      for the final battle. Don't apply <EM>too</EM> much soapy water here -- if 
      too much of it stays in the tire, it can throw off the balance, corrode 
      the rim, possibly break down the rubber, etc. Remember: use a 
      wet-but-not-dripping sponge. <BR><BR>If you get the lower side's bead nice 
      and soapy, and you get the angle just right, you can sort of slam the tire 
      on and very quickly get the thing halfway on. Here's <A

      You shouldn't have too much trouble getting the tire to this point (though 
      sometimes it helps to have <A 
      href="./michael.jpg">two 
      people</A>.) Since you did such a good job of soaping up the lower bead, 
      you should mostly be able to push that side down over the top of the rim. 
      Once you get one side down over the rim, pushing it down towards the 
      center well of the rim should help, as it gives the opposite side of the 
      tire (the part you're about to lever over the rim) more slack, making your 
      job much easier. (More on this shortly.) You'll probably need to use a 
      tire iron or two (and rim protectors!) to pry the last side over, but the 
      bottom bead -- and first half of the top bead -- will slide over pretty 
      easily.

      Before going on to the last half of the top bead, you'll probably want to 
      put a little tire lubricant/soapy water on the edge of the bead that's 
      going to have to slide over the rim. But if you're doing this by yourself, 
      you may not want to -- skipping the lubricant may help prevent the bead 
      (that you just levered over the rim) from slipping back up and over. You 
      can always add a little soapy water or lubricant later if need be. 
      <BR><BR><STRONG><U>Hint</U>:</STRONG> It'll give the end you're trying to 
      pry over the rim some very useful slack if you can keep the beads on the 
      other end of the rim down in the well between the bead ridges. If this 
      doesn't make sense, look at <A 
      href="./tireshift.jpg">this 
      diagram</A>. See how if the left side of the tire's bead is sitting up on 
      the lip, then the right side (that you're trying to lever over) is held 
      closer to the rim and doesn't have as much slack? Ideally you want the 
      beads to be sitting in the well in the middle of the rim, so the other end 
      -- the end you're fighting to lever over -- has as much slack as possible. 
      If you're having trouble doing all of these things at the same time, you 
      might be able to hold the top bead down in the middle of the wheel well 
      with <A 
      href="./swalldown.jpg">a 
      small block of wood</A> wedged between the sidewall and the underside of 
      the rim. (Be careful, of course, not to let any wood bits fall into the 
      tire!) Some people also report success holding the upper and lower 
      sidewalls together (in the middle well of the wheel) with multiple <A 
      href="./cclamp.jpg">C-clamps 
      on the sidewall</A>. I've never needed to do this, but as long as you're 
      careful not to harm the sidewall, it sounds like it could work. 
      <BR><BR>It'll usually be enough to push the beads at the opposite end into 
      the center well of the wheels just once. But if you're mounting 
      low-profile tires like those found on the back of modern sportbikes, the 
      forces you're applying to the end that you're levering over will probably 
      keep seating the beads on the opposite side. Which <EM>is</EM> what you 
      want -- eventually -- but for now you need slack, so you <EM>don't</EM> 
      want the beads seated yet. This just means that you'll need to push the 
      opposite-end's beads (top and bottom) into the middle well of the rim a 
      couple of times. No big deal.

      <STRONG><U>Hint</U>:</STRONG> If you're having trouble with this step, 
      there are a few tricks you can try. First, if you don't have a helper, you 
      might be able to hold an extra-long iron under your arm while you 
      manipulate the other two. Be creative -- and careful. Second, try 
      leap-frogging the irons around the rim in smaller steps. The smaller the 
      distance between the irons, the more points you'll have to pry from... but 
      you'll also have to use less force. Never try to force things -- breaking 
      or gouging things gets expensive, not to mention that you can hurt 
      yourself if things slip. Finally, don't forget the previous hint about 
      pushing the beads on the opposite side down into the well in the 
      centerline of the rim -- you need all the slack you can get, particularly 
      with low-profile rear tires. (Which will probably keep trying to re-seat 
      their beads on the side opposited the end you're working on. Don't let 
      them! Helpers can also push the opposite side's beads down into the center 
      of the rim throughout this step -- it often has to be done multiple 
      times.)

      the Beads &amp; Inflate the Tire</STRONG> 
      <HR noShade SIZE=2 width="100%">
      Congrats! It's safe to put the tire irons and rim protectors away. Pat 
      yourself on the back, then take the valve cap off. You also want to take 
      the valve core out if your tire chuck doesn't need it to trigger the air 
      flow. (Many chucks do require the valve core to be in place, but it 
      impedes air flow, so if you can possibly get away with not having it 
      there, do so -- you'll need a <U>lot</U> less pressure to seat the beads. 
      Really -- if at all possible, figure out a way to do this without the 
      valve core in place.) It's time for the next-to-last step: seating the 
      beads. <BR><BR>I'll admit, up front, that this is my least favorite part. 
      It involves inflating the tire to a high pressure such that the beads pop 
      into the ridges along the edge of the rim that they sit in. (See <A 
      href="beadseat.jpg">the rim closeup</A> in 
      <A href="./motorcycletirechanging.htm#5">step 
      five</A>.) They do not typically do this in a subtle way. Most people 
      suggest starting with 40-45 psi; if that fails to seat the beads, you'll 
      hear (or feel) air rushing out along the sidewall of the tire. If this 
      happens, you may need to bounce the tire around on the places where air is 
      escaping. Sometimes bouncing the tire on this point flexes the tire 
      carcass and moves the bead such the tire will seal, and you can build 
      enough pressure in the tire to pop the bead into place. If nothing seems 
      to be able to seat the bead, you might try putting a ratcheting-tie-down 
      around the circumference of the tire, and constricting it -- which 
      flattens the tire, and pushes the beads against the rim, and often gets 
      the beads to seal. Or you can up the air pressure, but if you do so, you 
      need to be very careful to only use a higher pressure to get the beads to 
      seal -- reduce the pressure back down to 40-45 psi to actually pop them 
      into place. </TD></TR>

      In any event, eventually, you will hear <U>two</U> distinctive, possibly 
      <STRONG>LOUD</STRONG> snapping/popping sounds as the beads snap into place 
      on the outer ridges of the rim. If you don't hear two, only one side is 
      seated. Once both sides are seated, stop inflating the tire. It's OK if 
      there's no valve core in place and all the air rushes out. The beads will 
      stay seated, and you can put more air in shortly. <BR><BR>As a matter of 
      safety, inspect the beads carefully. Many tires have a raised line drawn 
      on the sidewall -- you can tell that a bead is seated evenly because this 
      raised line will be a uniform distance from the edge of the rim the whole 
      way around, on both sides. If it isn't, the bead is probably not seated, 
      and the tire isn't ready for use. Click on the link to <A 
      href="./ridge.jpg">this 
      picture</A>, where the green arrows point to the raised line on the 
      sidewall that should be a constant distance from the edge of the rim (that 
      the red arrows point to.) Remember to check all the way around on both 
      sides. (Here's <A 
      href="./beadridge.jpg">another 
      shot</A> of the raised stripe on the sidewall. It's the stripe right below

  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>Now that the beads are steated, reinstall the valve core (if 
      it isn't already in the valve stem.) Inflate/deflate the tire to the 
      pressure recommended by its manufacturer for your vehicle and riding 
      style. Reinstall the valve stem cap. Make sure to check the air pressure 
      again in a day or two, as it may need a tad more air at first. (And, of 
      course, make sure to check tire pressures before riding on any tires.) 
      <BR><BR>You can also use the residual soapy water to check for leaks. (If 
      you were using a commercial or homemade tire-lubricant in place of soapy

      href="./shrooms.jpg">the 
      "mushroom" patches</A> are the safest things to use, so that's what I 
      bought. <BR><BR>Following the instructions that came with <A 
      href="./shrooms.jpg">the 
      patches</A> and the special tire/rubber adhesive that I got at an auto 
      parts place, I pushed the plug part of the patch through the hole from the 
      inside out, making sure to get lots of adhesive over the surfaces that 
      were going to have to stick together, and also taking care to press air 
      bubbles out of the junction. Then I cut the <A 
      href="./installed.jpg">excess 
      rubber</A> off, leaving <A 
      href="./outsidedone.jpg">a 
      nice, clean repair</A>. After allowing the adhesive time to dry, I 
      inspected the repair, which seemed to be solid and successful. Then I 
      mounted the tire, re-balanced it (the patch weighs something, y'know), and 
      put it back on the bike. Now let's just hope I don't experience a 
      catastrophic blowout causing a firey crash... &nbsp; Here's <A 
      href="./insidepatch.jpg">what 
      the installed patch</A> looks like from the inside of the tire ... the 
      darker area around the patch are roughing marks from the buffing wheel. 
      <BR><BR><STRONG>News flash:</STRONG> Well, I'm not dead yet, and 700 hard 
      miles later, the patch is essentially indistinguishable from the rubber it 
      replaces. Here's <A 
      href="./lateron.jpg">a 
      closeup.</A> <BR><BR><STRONG>News flash:</STRONG> A mere hundred miles 
      into another new set of tires, and the rear tire picked up a broken 
      masterlink clip and got cut in a very non-repairable sort of way. The 
      broken masterlink clip cut the tire in addition to puncturing it; to the 
      best of my knowledge, there are no products available for repairing cuts, 
      so the tire had to be thrown out. Sigh. When life hands you lemons, you 
      make lemondade, right? Well, life has been handing me a lot of lemon--er, 
      sharp objects lately (via my rear tire), so now I have a gallery of <A 
      href="http://www.clarity.net/~adam/tifimt.html">Things I've Found In My 
      Tires</A>. <BR><BR><STRONG>Epilogue to epilogue:</STRONG> A set of tires 
      (or two) later, something put <A 
      href="./cut.jpg">a 
      very deep cut</A> in my rear tire. It was getting to be time to replace 
      the tire anyway, so I wasn't too upset, but I do plan on getting a little 
      more use out of the tire at some point, and I want to remember what 
      condition it's in before I do. I think I'm going to patch the tire rather 
      than hope that the cut doesn't eventually fail on its own. Owning a <A 
      href="./tiremarker.jpg">tire 
      crayon</A> makes it very easy to <A 
      href="./marker.jpg">mark 
      the tire</A> with the location of the cut and how much use it has seen to 
      date. </TD></TR>
