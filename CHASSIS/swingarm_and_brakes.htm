<font face="Times New Roman" class="fsx05" color="#000000">Greetings all,<br>
    I'd like to ring in on the subject of Hayne's manual omissions with a<br>
question, followed by a true story that may prevent others from unneccesary<br>
grief with a trick or two I pulled out of somewhere.<br>
    My bike is an '80 650-G that served PO for many years, then it sat for<br>
about six years in a barn. I'm doing a slow but Spock- methodical rehab, and<br>
I figured I'd do all the prudent checks to make sure it's right.<br>
    One problem that led to it being parked was that the back brake stuck.<br>
You could ride it, but if you used the back brake the pedal wouldn't come<br>
back up. You could pull it back up with your foot or hand, and the brake<br>
wouldn't drag. Not good.<br>
    I put it up on the centerstand, and removed the wheel. Simple. Opened<br>
the brakes and the shoes were pretty much worn completely. Okay. Ordered<br>
some more from MAW. A couple of days' wait for the shoes plus the tire on<br>
the way. Got a couple of days to tinker.<br>
    Today I took the shocks loose, and proceeded to check the swing arm<br>
bearings for side to side movement as well as smoothness of stroke. What<br>
Haynes leaves out is that if you tie the shocks out of the way with zip<br>
ties, you can get a feel for movement without the swing arm smacking into<br>
the shocks that just kinda dangle in the way. Mine felt nice and smooth up<br>
and down, and side to side, although with the machine on the centerstand on<br>
a tile floor you couldn't really shake too hard. I figured the bearings to<br>
be ok. (wrong)<br>
    Leaving that for the moment, with the tire out of the way I had a half a<br>
good look at the brake pedal mechanism.  Even disconnected from the brakes,<br>
as well as the return spring the pedal took way more effort to move ten<br>
degrees or so. Not good. Hmmn. Maybe I'll Just Push It Out And Lube It Like<br>
The Haynes Manual Picture.<br>
    My Haynes manual has a picture (p.170 in the XJ650 and Xj750 '80-'82) of<br>
a happy rear brake I guess I used to call bell-crank slid out of it's normal<br>
position towards the inside of the bike. The helpfull caption reads "Link<br>
can be displaced inwards to permit greasing" I'll admit that said photo is<br>
vague in which model such ease of access could be for. It would be easy in<br>
deluding yourself to feel that that's all you have to do.<br>
    What the manual is leaving out is that in order to get such access (as<br>
well as such a clear and it's easy! photo for your repair manual) you have<br>
to take off the swingarm first.<br>
    There's no way around it. So, ok, the book says to Prise the final<br>
driveshaft gaiter off the box and gain access to the drive shaft flange,<br>
etc. and slacken four flange bolts , turning the flange as necessary to gain<br>
access to bolts.<br>
    But it's like taking off a u-joint on a rear wheel drive car. Those four<br>
bolts need to be tight because they're passing along all that pushes you<br>
along.<br>
    What the book could mention is that in order to break loose those extra<br>
tight bolts....it helps a lot if you put the back wheel back on. Drop the<br>
bike into gear. If, like me, you have the shocks disconnected, the yoke<br>
holding the u-joint will rub on the tube, but not enough to break loose the<br>
bolts. With enough effort, the tire will turn, but it's less effort than you<br>
need to break the bolts free. My solution was a big enough rubber<br>
mallet(under the tire) that kept the tire from rotating. As I broke one<br>
free, i'd find neutral, pick up the tire and rotate it until I had a clear<br>
shot at the next bolt, then back into gear. The rest was easy.<br>
    After I got the pivot bolts loose, it fell right out. I will warn you<br>
that the proper tension for these things are in the 70 ft/lbs area.  I was<br>
careful removing the grease seals to the swing arm bearings. I thought they<br>
were okay, and the bearings were in good shape, but covered with surface<br>
rust, and what was left of the grease had dried into a nice mud-like grunge.<br>
    With the swing arm out of the way, using a five pound dead blow hammer<br>
and many swings, I got the brake pivot crank out. It was covered with this<br>
glue like brown funk, as was the sleeve in the frame it goes through.<br>
Luckily not bent. A little cleaning and some grease, it'll be okay.<br>
    Please, fellow travelers, if you're thinking about this kind of<br>
maintenance, I hope I helped.<br>
    Matt<br>
