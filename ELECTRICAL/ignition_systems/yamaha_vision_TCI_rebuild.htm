<H4>** RA11/RB11, RA12,RB12 are "run-time" components. That means they are 
selected at the time of actual assembly to adjust some values on the board. No 2 
TCI are alike here and the resister values can't be predicted. The values here 
are examples of what was found in (1) TCI module.</H4>

  <P><I>My thanks to Dick Stelter, David Denowh, Uwe Werner, Brian Fosh of 
  TzRewinds and many others for what follows.</I></P>
  <P><B>There is a good chance you can repair the TCI module</B>. A little 
  soldering skill may be all it takes. This is a "work in progress" so this is 
  only a start. I believe we will repair a couple Vision TCI in 2001 and answer 
  many questions.General speaking, it is most likely the transistors which have 
  failed on the circuit board. Also, some have reported loose solder connections 
  that have been corrected with some cleaning and resoldering. However, the 
  Vision TCI circuit board is a "doublesided plated thru design" which means the 
  components are mounted on one side but soldered on the other. This is a strong 
  design and makes weak solder joints less likely. The Virago TCI which is very 
  similar uses a single sided design where the components are soldered on the 
  same side as the circuit foil. This makes it more prone for the circuit foil 
  to peel up and fail due to vibration (a problem less likely on the Vision TCI 
  board). The Vision TCI is more prone to component failure where the Virage TCI 
  oftens fails to mechanical failure.David Denowh is currently reconditioning 
  TCI for the Virago group. This TCI is very similar to the Vision with the 
  obvious difference being that it is a 3 cylinder bike. Here is the link if 
  you're curious:</P>
  <P><A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/ddenowh/TCI/index.html">http://members.aol.com/ddenowh/TCI/index.html</A></P>
  <P>The problem of course is testing what you have done and Dave has no easy 
  way to test a reconditioned Vision module. In the UK Paul Fosh is rebuilding 
  TZI at "TZRebuild" and testing them with a test bench setup. He mechanically 
  rotates a magnet with a drill motor past the pickups to simulate the engine 
  RPM. Here are some of Dave's comments:"I have been very lucky with the Virago 
  repairs thus far. I have done over 150 TCI units and they ALL have had similar 
  problems. Resoldering the board has repaired them all with only a few needing 
  the transistors replaced. I suspect these went bad because the bike either had 
  a bad coil or had a wire pinched somewhere. The transistors on the Virago are 
  a bit different. The part number is either a ETD051-030 or a D1071. Both have 
  the S with a line through and a circle around the logo like the Vision ETD41. 
  I have replaced these with a RCA part #SK9431. I suspect that any transistor 
  that is similar or stronger will work as a replacement. It is just a switch 
  after all :-)".</P>
  <P><B>Here's what we think we know so far: </B>The Vision TCI ignitor was 
  supplied by Hitachi as part #TID 12-06. The semiconductor (fast switching 
  transistor) inside marked ETD41 was made by Fuji Electronics. Fuji also 
  produces ignitors and maybe even builds them for Hitachi too!? They also 
  produce a line of after market ignitors, some advertised under other brand 
  names for homebuilt aircraft.The ETD41's are diode protected Darlington NPN 
  transistors. You want to replace these with heavier duty substitutes. We can 
  make a good guess at what that would be based on the TCI and coil 
  voltages/currents. This should probably be something that can handles 8 amps+ 
  at the collector and double that for peak. The BU806 from Fairchild (spec 
  below) , SGS Thompson, and NTE2315 should work. The NTE2315 is slightly more 
  expensive (we're talking a couple dollars total here) but is more readily 
  available on the net.Again, the Virago is similar in vintage and electrical 
  design so for discussion notice that the power semiconductors in a Virago 
  ignitor are marked D1071. They have also been replaced successfully with the 
  BU806 and ST9431.All the components in the Vision TCI have been identified and 
  are listed below. The exception is the 'piggy back' board on the printed 
  circuit board (called a Hybrid) which has an IC mounted on it. This is most 
  likely the timing curve. This can't be fixed and there's no obvious 
  replacement.</P>
  <P><B>Fixing the TCI:</B> This would be my recomended order of things till you 
  get it working.</P>
  <P><B>1.</B> <B>Gain access to the PCB ("Printed Circuit Board")</B>.</P>
  <P>Remove the top cover to the TCI (held by 4 screws).</P>
  <H3>
  <CENTER><I><U><FONT color=#ff0000>** DO NOT TRY TO PRY IC-BOARD OUT OF THE TCI 
  CASE!!! **</FONT></U></I></CENTER></H3>
  <P>It is held in by one small Philip screw, and MORE IMPORTANTLY, is soldered 
  to the plug pins molded into the side of the case. To get the board out you 
  have to desolder the pins or break them off when you take it out. You'd then 
  have to solder them (or wires connecting them) back together.</P>
  <P>
  <CENTER><B><FONT color=#ff0000>There is an another way.</FONT></B></CENTER>
  <P></P>
  <P>Try to avoid pulling the PCB out of the case. Replacing any components 
  while leaving the PCB still in the plastic box would be good. Ultimately you'd 
  like to reuse the case / wire plugs , the whole setup. To get to the other 
  side ..... cut a large "port-hole" into the plastic "bottom" (other side of 
  the case). Use a dremel tool small cutting wheel. This is risky because you 
  can accidentally cut into IC components on the board. MAYBE BETTER, a sharp 
  knife heated with a torch (so your melting through the plastic). Anyway.... 
  GOOD LUCK (Could be a Darwin award recipient!).</P>
  <P>Lay the case flat. Cut down (knife straight up + down) into the case about 
  1/2” in from the sides. Another words you're cutting a rectangular hole out of 
  the bottom cover 1/2” smaller than the bottom cover size. One end of the 
  module has the metal heat sinks which is why you need to cut about 1/2” in 
  from the sides.</P>
  <P>
  <CENTER><B>**** <FONT color=#ff0000 size=+1>Cut no deeper than about 1/8" or 
  you will cut into IC components</FONT> ****</B></CENTER>
