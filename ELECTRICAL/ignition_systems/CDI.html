  <P>A chain or belt drives a distributor. Inside this distributor is a spring 
  loaded contact switch ("POINTS") riding on a revolving cam. The points would 
  open and close to fire a single coil which would produce the spark. Inside the 
  distributor is also a "rotor" which rotates to determine which plug wire gets 
  the spark. To advance the "TIMING" of the spark a mechanical arm would adjust 
  the points position. As RPM increases spark starts to occur earlier. This is 
  usually done by a centrifical weight or by using a vacuum diaphragm. The 
  higher the RPM the higher engine vacuum would suck the diaphragm arm in 
  advancing the points timing.</P>

  NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></U></B>In the mid 1800's experts (including Michael 
  Faraday ... today "micro Farads " measure capacitance) developed the concept 
  that a current passing thru a coil wire creates a magnetic field. AND, more 
  importantly, a magnet passing by a coil wire creates a voltage current. The 
  amount of current depends on the magnetic size and speed (rate) the magnetic 
  field passes (or changes) by the coil. The math equation for this is 
  <B>e=-df/dt</B>. The change in magnetic field strength is <B>dt </B>and the 
  time (rate of change) is <B>dt</B>. Technically, <B>e</B> is the "Induced 
  EMF". But we talk of this as the current produced in the wire coil.</P>

  src="electronic_ign_overview_files/CoilTrans1Text.gif" width=265 
  NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">An iron core is wrapped with 2 long "coils" of wire. The 
  "PRIMARY" winding on the outside and the longer "SECONDARY" winding on the 
  inside. The wire length ratio is typically 100:1.</P>
  <P>The coil is fed 12v to the primary winding. This in turn creates a large 
  (enhanced by the iron rod) magnetic field which also surrounds the Secondary 
  windings. The coil is now storing a large magnetic field (a Flux" field). When 
  the +12v to the coil primary winding is turned off the magnetic ("flux") field 
  inside the coil "collapses". This causes a "Back EMF" (Electro Motive Force) 
  current in the primary wire of about 300-400volts. When the coil collapses 
  this rapidly changing magnetic field is also transferred to the "Secondary" 
  windings as current (remember ... a changing magnetic field passing by a 
  coil!).</P>
  <P>The Secondary winding is 100 times longer so produces a voltage about 100 
  times more than the Primary during collapse. Lets do the math. The Primary 
  (sometimes called "Low Tension") wire is about 400v during the Back EMF spike. 
  So the Secondary (sometimes called the "High Tension") wire is 100 x 
  300=30,000 volts. This high voltage is going somewhere, somehow to ground. The 
  faster the power cutoff is, the faster the collapse, and the faster (more 
  powerful) that spark is. So, when the points open (instantly cutting off power 
  to the coil) 30,000 volts goes to ground via the spark plug.</P>
  <P>Due to magnetic "flux" properties (research Teslar and the "left hand 
  rule"if you want to know more) the inductor (COIL) encourages current flow 
  towards the plug. But the collapsing magnetic field also produces the 
  phenomenon discussed above called "Back EMF". This 300+ voltage spike can 
  cause a mini-spark of it own across the points. To prevent this a CONDENSER is 
  added.</P>

  src="electronic_ign_overview_files/CapacitorTrans.gif" width=80 
  NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The condenser is a large capacitor (only the automotive 
  industry calls it a condenser?). It charges up to a smaller voltage. When the 
  points open this small charge is dumped into the larger coil which slows its 
  collapse. Remember, a coil output is strongest when the collapse is fast and 
  sharp. The condenser slows this collapse just long enough for the points to 
  get far enough apart so the coil back EMF output can't arc across that 
  distance. Without a condenser the backflow arcing and heat would destroy the 
  points (sometimes in a matter of seconds). However, the condenser can't be too 
  big or the coil would collapse too slow and not produce any spark (especially 
  at at higher RPM).</P>
  <P>Coil output is a function of coil windings "turns ratio" and also voltage 
  input. The more power you put in the more you get out, right? But, points are 
  a mechanical switch limited by how much current you can pump through them 
  without burning them up. Points are limited to about 250volts and 5 amps Coils 
  can handle up to about 7 amps and transistor switches about 10-20 amps.</P>

  <CENTER><B><U>DWELL</U></B></CENTER>
  <P></P>
  <P>Conventional ignition is affected by "Dwell time" (or dwell angle). Dwell 
  time refers to the time the points are closed thus recharging the coil. Dwell 
  angle refers to the crankshaft angle of rotation made while the points are 
  still closed. If dwell time (points closed) is too short the coil may not have 
  enough time to recharge at high RPM. So large dwell is better right? But, if 
  dwell is too large (points hardly open) then the points may not open at all 
  (slop and wear) AND the points may not be open long enough for the coil to 
  collapse (indirectly referred to as voltage "rise time"). The voltage rise 
  time in conventional ignitions is about 80 microseconds, 125ish for TCI, and 
  about 6microsec for modern CDI. Dwell limits the ability of points to deliver 
  high power at high RPM. Race teams got around this by using dual point systems 
  overlapping the dwell times to get what they needed.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The first improvement of electronic ignition was to replace the points with 
  a "solid state" semiconductor switch called a transistor. The advantage of a 
  transistor is that it can conduct up to near 400-500 volts (more power than 
  needed), is extremely accurate fast (in nanoseconds),and can last a long time 
  in the heat / vibration of an engine. The trick of course if how to trigger 
  the transistor switch. The common types of sensor systems that have evolved 
  are: optical, magnetic, "Hall" effect, and (for trivia purposes only) "ECKO". 
  In reverse order of today's usage:</P>

  <P></P>
  <P>This is the most widely used type of ignition sensor. The Hall effect 
  (named after the American physicist Edwin Herbert Hall, 1855-1938) involves 
  the generation of an "electric potential perpendicular to both an electric 
  current flowing along a conducting material and an external magnetic field 
  applied at right angles to the current upon application of the magnetic 
  field". <B><I>W-H-A-T ?!??</I></B>. Practically speaking, a current is passed 
  though a silican wafer. When a exposed to a magnetic field this disrupts the 
  current flow and distributes more "potential" on one side of the wafer. This 
  can be measured, conditioned, and amplified to trigger the ignition module. 
  Hall Effect sensors are extremely accurate, they produce a "square" wave 
  signal perfect for solid-state applications, and are very durable against heat 
  / vibration. The rotor magnet does not need to be as strong (you may not feel 
  its pull with a heavy screwdriver).</P>
  <P>Most Hall effect rotors involve a stationary Hall Switch and stationary 
  magnet. What rotates is an "Interrupter Blade". When the blade passes between 
  the sensor and the magnet it blocks the magnetic pull on the Hall Switch. When 
  a "shutter blade" is open, the magnetic field projects onto the Hall Sensor 
  switching it on. Again, a Hall system needs to be powered, so you will 
  typically see 3 wires to it.</P>

  <P>This is very popular and still used for many applications today because its 
  a rugged durable design. In addition the sensor is not powered (like in Hall 
  Effect) so it can be used in self powered magneto ignition applications. A 
  coil sensor is used to detect the "flux" a magnet produces when it passes 
  close by the sensor. This magnetic rotor is called a "Reluctor" (I betch ya 
  didn't know that one). The problem with magnetic is that at higher RPM the 
  sensor has trouble seeing "teeth" close together on the magnetic rotor. This 
  is a bigger problem with many cylinder engines and/or high RPM applications. 
  Also, you may remember magnets tend to loose their strength with vibration and 
  heat. Also, reluctors are stronger magnets (you can definitely feel the pull 
  if you get a screwdriver close) which tends to magnify things around it.</P>

  blade blocks the light path. Although accurate, the sensor is sensitive to 
  dirt and dust. This is not used much but is very common in aftermarket

  <P>"Eddy Current Killed Oscillator" systems were used by Lucas (yeah, the 
  British "Dark Lord"). It involves a 2 coil sensor that has current flowing. 
  The sensor detects the current disruption cause by a magnet passing by. It is 
  similar to "Hall Effect" in that it is extremely accurate and durable. But for 
  whatever reason is only used mainly in manufacturing automation 
  applications.</P>
  <H3>
  <CENTER><U>Modern Electronic Ignition Modules</U></CENTER></H3>
  <P>For the most part, there are 2 types of ignition systems in use today (or 
  variations of them): Induction ignition or CDI ("Capacitive Discharge 
  Ignition"). Both systems use a sensor (discussed above) to trigger a 
  transistor switch (which has replaced the points). CDI is more commonly used 
  and you'll see why.</P>
  <P><B>Induction Ignition:</B> This is called an induction system because the 
  coil is used as a power storage (an "inductor") device for the spark. 
  Remember, the coil is powered up, stores near 30,000 volts, and unleashes it 
  when the coil collapses (power supply cutoff). A feature of induction ignition 
  is the slightly longer spark duration while the coil collapses. This is an 
  advantage when starting and for igniting lean/high compression mixtures at 
  high RPM. These type of systems require coils meant for "induction" ignitions 
  (they have a higher resistance typically than CDI coils).</P>
  <P><B>CDI:</B> This type of ignition module is most widely used today. A CDI 
  module has "capacitor" storage of its own and sends a short high voltage 
  (about 250+ volts) pulse through the coil. The coil now acts more like a 
  transformer (instead of a storage inductor) and multiplies this voltage even 
  higher. Modern CDI coils step up the voltage about 100:1. So, a typical 250v 
  CDI module output is stepped up to over 25,000v output from the coil. The CDI 
  output voltage of course can be higher. So you'll see CDI systems claiming 
  coil output capability over 40,000-60,000 volts!!? As you will see this is not 
  exactly what happens at the plug but for math purposes it works out. The huge 
  advantage of CDI is the higher coil output and "hotter" spark. The spark 
  duration is much shorter (about 10-12 microseconds) and accurate. This is 
  better at high RPM but can be a problem for both starting and/or lean 
  mixture/high compression situations. CDI systems can and do use "low" 
  resistance coils. <B><I><U>AGAIN</U></I></B>, the potential output of CDI 
  coils can be over 40,000 volts. <B><I><FONT color=#ff0000>Lookout, 'cause this 
  can be L_E_T_H_A_L!!</FONT></I></B></P>
  <H3>
  <CENTER>CDI TRIVIA</CENTER></H3>
  <P>Dwell is pretty much a meaningless term in CDI. The transistor switches are 
  capable of nanosecond timing. And, the coil pulse "voltage rise time" to the 
  plug is VERY fast at around 6 microseconds. So at high RPM the spark firing 
  and duration time can be completely controlled to produce optimum coil 
  voltages.</P>
  <P>CDI was pioneered mainly by Bosch in Europe. Today we see a variety of 
  names to include: Ford's TFI (Thick Film Integrated ?!?), GM's HEI (High 
  Energy Ignition), DIS (Distributorless Ignition System), ECU (electronic 
  control unit),</P>
  <H3>
  <CENTER>Ignition Considerations</CENTER></H3>
  <P>The common question is: how much power do you need in an ignition system? 
  The more the better right? Well, not exactly. Lately it seems the talk is 
  always centered around high voltage (50,000+) low resistance racing coils, 
  aftermarket ignitions (MSD, Accel), etc... What is really important?</P>
  <P><B>Coil aspects: </B>"Rise time" refers to the time needed for the coil 
  voltage to reach 90% of its peak. Fast rise times are desired as they help 
  prevent and breakdown plug fouling (or "plug tracking"). Plug fouling occurs 
  when the spark is dissipated and runs to "ground" across deposits on the 
  <U>plug's surface</U> instead of across the <U>plug gap</U>. These deposits 
  can be carbon buildup, corrosion, lead salts, water, etc. Rise times for 
  ignition systems are typically 80-120 microseconds for induction systems and 6 
  microsec for CDI.</P>
  <P>It takes about 12-14,000 volts to initiate the spark across the plug gap. 
  After the initial arc the voltage required to sustain the arc is much less and 
  drops off significantly. So while you may have a manufacturer claimed 60,000 
  volt racing coil you can't actually get that across the plug. Since the 
  advantage of CDI is the higher coil output, how does that get used. Well, 
  normally it doesn't. The extra power possible in the coil is "Reserve 
  Voltage". As the plugs wear, fouling, plug wires and connections get worse 
  then the required firing voltage may go up 1-5,000 volts. So the "hotter" CDI 
  coil output can help overcome these obstacles and the ignition system will 
  last longer. So, its not that its working better.... but rather lasting longer 
  that makes a hot coil good. The ideal coil output needed for normal 
  applications is about 30,000 volts.</P>
  <P><B>High RPM / High Compression / Racing applications: </B>Newer techniques 
  are being used to increase spark output. Additionally, CDI typically has a 
  very short spark duration near 10-12 microseconds. As discussed you can't push 
  more than about 20,000 volt across the plug without other stange phenomenon 
  happening. If you were to try you would see arcing down the side of the plug, 
  across carbon buildups at the electrode end, out any weak points in the wire 
  insulation, connections, etc... So how do you get a better spark? Newer 
  ignitions (like MSD-5 for example) are outputting a finely controlled multiple 
  spark pattern into the plug. Instead of one big spark a shower of short 
  duration sparks are flooded across the combustion stroke. This makes for a 
  much more efficient burn. Using this technique newer CDI can achieve longer 
  spark duration times (near 250). This is particularly better for starting, 
  lean mixtures (which are hard to ignite), and high compression situations.</P>
  <P>
  <CENTER><B><FONT size=+1>Ignition Future</FONT></B></CENTER>
  <P></P>
  <P>New generation auto ignitions will be designed for more accuracy, better 
  efficiency and reliability. This will include "crank angle" sensors to improve 
  timing and fuel injection accuracy (example, mounting the Hall sensor and 
  magnets on the flyheel). Newer coils will be wound around an "E" shaped pole 
  (not "center wound"). They will look like a square module and not the round 
  cyclinder you've seen all these years. You'll see separate coils mounted atop 
  each spark plug. This improves spark power (no plug wires), accuracy, and most 
  importantly reduces RFI (radio frequency interference) problems. Timing and 
  spark duration times will be adjusted across the RPM range. It also eliminates 
  the need for a distributor rotor altogether. Additionally, timing advance will 
  be calculated for a variety of inputs including increasing RPM vs. decreasing 
  RPM (braking or coasting), throttle position, etc.</P>
  <P>This push towards a truly "no moving parts" ignition with reliability and 
  amazing accuracy is the way of the future.</P>
  <P>
  <CENTER><B><FONT size=+1>Making Yours a Better Ignition</FONT></B></CENTER>
  <P></P>
  <P>The bigger enemy against ignition is RFI and insulation leakage. Basically, 
  you want the best insulated (thicker, 12mm?) and well made plug wires you can 
  get. Upgrade your CDI module if you want to spend a little more for higher 
  performance. Although a good coil is always a plus, we've discussed how 
  meaningless those manufacturers high output claims can be in practicality. In 
  short, spend your money on good plug wires, good plugs, and then an upgraded 
  CDI module/coil combination.</P>
