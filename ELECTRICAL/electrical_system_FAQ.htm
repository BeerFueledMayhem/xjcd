1. Introduction: <br>
<br>
So you've got yourself an XJ bike, and it seems to be doing something<br>
strange of an electrical nature. The early eighties were a great time<br>
for motorcycles. Modern performance just coming into its own, more<br>
power, better ergonomics, but still those really gorgeous air-cooled<br>
engines, polished aluminum unfettered by stupid decal-laden GOOF-2<br>
style fairings. And new, more complicated electrical systems, that<br>
are just now starting to show their time induced weaknesses. <br>
<br>
This document is meant to be a starting point for discussions about<br>
the Electrical System of the 1980's Yamaha's XJ bikes. Although most<br>
of the information applies to XJ650s and XJ750s, some is specific for<br>
the Seca 750. Other information may pertain to motorcycles in<br>
general. It is not meant to be a substitute for a good wiring diagram<br>
and manual. I have tried to avoid many of the electrical myths that<br>
seem to show up so commonly. <br>
<br>
2. Fuse Box: <br>
<br>
There are four fuses in the fuse box under the seat. The main fuse<br>
(30 amp) connects the battery to the both the alternator output and<br>
the bike's key switch (which feeds the other 3 fuses). The battery<br>
charges through the main fuse while the bike is running, and feeds<br>
the other fuses when the bike isn't. The other fuses, each 10 amp,<br>
are for the headlight (and driving light), ignition, and signals<br>
(turn signals, brake etc.) There is a fifth fuse, behind the<br>
headlight that feeds the parking and dash lights. <br>
<br>
2.1 Replacing: <br>
<br>
The fuse box on these bikes sucks. It is the first thing you should<br>
replace. It sucks because it uses glass barrel-style auto fuses and<br>
exposed, crimped connectors which are all subject to corrosion. Since<br>
it is connected directly into the wiring harness, periodically<br>
installing new connectors can leave you without enough wire. <br>
<br>
Replace each of the four fuses with in-line ATC Blade type fuse<br>
holders and fuses. Solder, seal and shrink wrap these into the<br>
harness, there is plenty of room under the seat for them. Don't use<br>
multiple fuse blocks, the in-line holders are better protected from<br>
the elements and less prone to corrosion. Mark each fuse with<br>
permanent ink, and add a few nylon wire ties, and you're in business. <br>
<br>
A corroded original fuse block is notorious for causing intermittent<br>
problems brought on by vibration. Things like ignition cut out, total<br>
power failure, loss of headlights, and stalling at idle are examples. <br>
<br>
3. Battery: <br>
<br>
The standard battery (most models) is a Yuasa Yumicron YB14L-A2 12<br>
volt lead acid/antimony battery. It is rated for 14 ampere-hours (at<br>
10 hour discharge rate), and 190 cold-cranking amps. 14 AH<br>
(ampere-hours) is a measure of the battery's capacity, and 190 CCA<br>
(cold-cranking amps) is a measure of how much current the battery can<br>
supply to the starter when it is cold out. (See www.yuasabatteries.com<br>
for lots of useful battery info.) <br>
<br>
Yuasa also makes one of its GRT (Gas recombination technology)<br>
batteries that will fit the bike, although it is not clear that<br>
Yamaha's battery sensor system is compatible (it can easily be<br>
bypassed.) A catalyst material is used to recombine the battery<br>
gasses so that the periodic addition of distilled water is<br>
unnecessary. <br>
<br>
*[Bypassing the sensor is a simple as connecting the sensor wire to<br>
the positive terminal on the battery.]* <br>
<br>
Lead-acid batteries contain both lead and sulfuric acid. The lead is<br>
dangerous to the environment. That is the reason old batteries should<br>
be disposed of properly. The acid is dangerous to clothing, hands,<br>
paint, etc., but can be neutralized easily with baking soda or lime.<br>
For people interested in the chemistry, <br>
<br>
   Pb (s) + PbO2 (s) + 2 H2SO4 (35%aq) --> 2 PbSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)<br>
 <br>
is a representation of the primary chemical reaction inside the<br>
battery during discharge. As the battery discharges, lead, lead oxide<br>
and sulfuric acid are converted into lead sulfate and water. This is,<br>
of course, more than you wanted to know. <br>
<br>
3.1 Battery Health: <br>
<br>
A strong battery is required to keep your bike in good running shape.<br>
<br>
A bad battery can: <br>
<br>
--Make it difficult to start the bike. While it could have enough<br>
juice to turn the starter, the voltage might drop so low, the<br>
electronic ignition will not spark well or at all. <br>
<br>
--Draw too much current from the alternator while running. This may<br>
cause spark problems and possibly do bad things to the alternator or<br>
the regulator. <br>
<br>
--Cause stalling at idle. The battery may not have enough reserve<br>
power to keep the ignition and lighting going when the alternator is<br>
moving slowly. <br>
<br>
3.2 Check your battery: <br>
<br>
A battery hydrometer can be purchased in an auto parts store, it is<br>
used to measure the state of charge of the battery. It basically<br>
measures the amount of sulfuric acid in solution by specific gravity<br>
(the "density" of the electrolyte). They come with instructions. <br>
<br>
Standard batteries are fully charged at 1.265 specific gravity.<br>
Yuasa's YuMicron, and other batteries with sulfate stop additives are<br>
fully charged at 1.280. (The sulfate stop additive, included in<br>
YuMicron batteries, increases battery life by reducing sulfation.) <br>
<br>
You can also load test the battery, although an automotive load<br>
tester is likely to draw too much current for an accurate test, it<br>
can be used to give you an idea of the battery's condition. A more<br>
accurate test is to measure battery voltage during cranking. Simply<br>
apply your voltmeter to the battery and turn over the motor with the<br>
"engine off" switch engaged. Battery voltage shouldn't drop below 9<br>
or so volts while the starter is going. <br>
<br>
3.3 Battery Survival: <br>
<br>
There are several things you can do to keep your battery in good<br>
shape for a long time. The life-time of a lead-acid battery is about<br>
5-10 years, although automotive manufacturers tend to warrantee them<br>
for less time. The die early from: Deep discharges, overcharging,<br>
electrolyte contamination, and loss of electrolyte. <br>
<br>
When you buy your battery: Be sure to fully charge the battery<br>
before first use. Simply filling with electrolyte only brings the<br>
battery to about 80% charge. If you use the battery before fully<br>
charging it, you will damage it permanently. Unscrupulous motorcycle<br>
dealerships don't think this is a big deal. I do, and so does Yuasa.<br>
1.5 amps for three or four hours should do it. <br>
<br>
During the season: Keep an eye on the charging voltage and<br>
electrolyte level of your battery. Watch for overcharging: See the<br>
section on "batteries boiling" for details. Always use distilled<br>
water when adding to the electrolyte; do not overfill. Be sure the<br>
vent tube is installed and clear of painted parts on the bike. <br>
<br>
During the off season: It's a good idea to remove the battery from<br>
the bike to prevent leakage and corrosion. Check the electrolyte and<br>
keep the battery charged. Either use the "battery tender" type<br>
charger (which maintains the correct "float" voltage) or, one or two<br>
days each month, use a trickle charger. Remember to charge in a well<br>
ventilated place. Garages work well. The cold doesn't hurt them much<br>
if the battery has a good charge, and neither does storing it on a<br>
cement floor. (Those are myths.) <br>
<br>
3.4 Battery Sensor: (Not all models) [Top] <br>
<br>
There is a battery sensor on this bike. It consists of a single wire<br>
and electrode which replaces the third cell cover from the negative<br>
terminal on the battery. This sensor tells the dashboard computer a<br>
couple of things. <br>
<br>
1) If the battery is working correctly, the electrode will sense<br>
between 4 and 6 volts. <br>
<br>
2) If the battery electrolyte is low in the third cell, the sensor<br>
will no longer be submerged in electrolyte, causing no voltage to be<br>
sensed, and triggering the "batt" warning light. <br>
<br>
3) If the battery voltage is to low, due to a charging problem, the<br>
voltage in the third cell will also be low, triggering the "batt"<br>
warning light. <br>
<br>
The sensor tip requires periodic cleaning. Over time, the tip of the<br>
sensor will become plated with lead sulfate, causing a resistive<br>
drop, and making the "batt" light come on. Clean the tip with<br>
scotch-bright, emery cloth, fine sand paper, etc., and you'll be back<br>
in business. <br>
<br>
Additionally, Yuasa warns that different batteries use different size<br>
and shape sensors. If you switch battery brands or models, check to<br>
see if a new sensor is available for that battery. <br>
<br>
4. Starter Solenoid: <br>
<br>
The starter solenoid is an electromechanical device that allows power<br>
to be applied to the starter motor remotely. It is simply a big<br>
single pole relay. Inside the solenoid there is a 12 volt<br>
electromagnetic coil, which, when energized, closes heavy duty<br>
contacts, allowing current to flow between the two big terminals. <br>
<br>
There are four terminals altogether, the two big terminals, and the<br>
two coil wires which are soldered to the solenoid and plug into the<br>
wiring harness with a two wire connector. The solenoid is located<br>
next to the battery. <br>
<br>
In general, when solenoids die, it is because the coil has developed<br>
either a short or open circuit. A short will most likely blow a fuse.<br>
If the coil is open circuit, it won't even click if you push the<br>
button. <br>
<br>
The internal contacts can also stop working. This is usually<br>
indicative of a problem with the load or power supply (starter motor<br>
or battery) caused by excessive sparking or current. One owner<br>
reported repairing the internal contacts by opening the solenoid and<br>
soldering in new home made contacts, with good results. The solenoid<br>
is not designed for this, but its an option of you feel capable. <br>
<br>
It is most common, however, for a solenoid to *seem* dead because of<br>
wiring problems, corrosion, etc. <br>
<br>
4.1 Checking the Solenoid: <br>
<br>
If you have an intermittent starting problem, don't suspect the<br>
solenoid first. The most likely causes are wiring, connectors and<br>
switches. See the section on corrosion for details. Check the starter<br>
switch, fuses, interlock switches and relays, and all the connectors. <br>
<br>
If you suspect the solenoid is not working, the first thing to do is<br>
to confirm that the rest of the bike is in proper working order.<br>
Carefully pull aside the rubber terminal covers on solenoid. Use<br>
caution, as the contacts are still live. With the bike ignition<br>
turned on, be certain the bike is in neutral, short the big terminals<br>
with an insulated screwdriver. (Keep your fingers away and don't<br>
touch the frame of the bike with the screwdriver!) A spark should<br>
fly, and the bike should turn over. If the engine doesn't turn over,<br>
this means something other than the solenoid is not working (suspect<br>
the battery, the starting motor, and wiring). Fix this problem before<br>
reassessing the solenoid. <br>
<br>
If the engine does turn over, then the problem exists in either the<br>
solenoid, the wiring between the solenoid and the starter button,<br>
relays, or the starter button itself. In order to narrow it down to<br>
just the solenoid, apply 12 volts directly to the coil wires to see<br>
if the bike starts. Disconnect the two wire connector from the<br>
solenoid. Then, using some wire, apply 12 volts to the connector<br>
directly from the battery. This should cause the solenoid to click<br>
and start the bike. (Again, be certain you are in neutral.) If it<br>
doesn't, double check all of the solenoid's external wiring and<br>
connector for breakage or corrosion. If there is nothing external to<br>
fix, then it is time to replace the solenoid. <br>
<br>
5. The Starter: <br>
<br>
Its a fine starter, as starter motors go. The most common problem is<br>
the starter spinning but not engaging. This is a mechanical problem<br>
in the starter clutch, usually having to do with the starter drivers,<br>
and will not be dealt with here. <br>
<br>
A few XJ owners have had to repair or replace the starter. Some<br>
simply needed new brushes, which are available at a premium from<br>
Yamaha. (One owner was able to modify generic brushes to do the<br>
trick.) Others had to resurface the commutator, and cut back the mica<br>
separators. <br>
<br>
If you think your starter may be malfunctioning, see the manual<br>
excerpt for information on repairing it. Note that if you replace the<br>
brushes yourself, it is extremely important to be sure they make very<br>
good contact with the commutator. <br>
<br>
The biggest problem I have with the starter is that it is too good.<br>
In an automobile, the first thing affected by a weak battery is the<br>
starter (or starter solenoid.) The design in a car means that if you<br>
have enough juice to engage the starter and turn the engine over, you<br>
have enough power to get everything else going, i.e., the ignition.<br>
This is not the case with this bike. The bike will crank fine with a<br>
weak battery, even if there isn't enough "left over" to spark the<br>
ignition. This can be very frustrating. <br>
<br>
Solution: Don't have a weak battery. Don't have resistive drops in<br>
the path to the ignition module and coils. <br>
<br>
6. Alternator/Rectifier/Regulator: <br>
<br>
This bike uses Hitachi's three phase regulated alternator. What this<br>
means is, instead of rotating a permanent magnet around or inside<br>
stator coils, generating a voltage, the regulated alternator uses<br>
what is essentially a variable rotating electromagnet. This<br>
"electromagnet" rotor is fed a current which is adjusted to keep the<br>
output of the alternator between 14.2 and 14.8 volts (with no load). <br>
<br>
The regulator/rectifier box is the gadget that does this adjusting.<br>
The rectifier part simply converts the 3 phase AC output of the<br>
alternator into (somewhat ripply) direct current using diodes. The<br>
regulator part is where the magic occurs. <br>
<br>
First, the regulator must know what voltage is coming out of the<br>
alternator. So it looks at a brown wire that comes from the front of<br>
the bike via the ignition switch. This wire gets its power from the<br>
ignition switch and also feeds the fuses in the secondary circuits<br>
(ignition, headlights, etc.) The ignition switch gets ITS power from<br>
both the rectified output of the alternator and the battery (red<br>
wires). This is a very long loop (see Battery Overcharging for<br>
details.) <br>
<br>
The regulator looks at the voltage on the brown wire, then pushes an<br>
appropriate amount of current through the rotor windings to make the<br>
output voltage (red wire) right. On these bikes the rotor wires are<br>
green and brown (actually the same brown wire as above), and are<br>
connected to the regulator/rectifier box. The green wire is the one<br>
that does all the work. If you measure the voltage on the green wire<br>
(between green and ground) you should see it go from about 1.8 volts<br>
at 2000 rpm up to 9-11 volts when you rev the engine, as the<br>
regulator does its thing. <br>
<br>
6.1 Alternator Connections: <br>
<br>
There are five wires connected to the alternator. Two, (brown and<br>
green) feed the rotor from the voltage regulator. Corrosive<br>
resistance drops in the connectors for these wires can keep the<br>
regulator from reaching the proper voltage. <br>
<br>
Three (white) wires comprise the alternator's output. These wires,<br>
which carry three-phase alternating current, go to the rectifier<br>
(part of the voltage regulator), where the power is converted to<br>
direct current. A common problem is corrosion in the connections<br>
under the seat and on the regulator. This causes the alternator to<br>
work too hard and can melt connectors. <br>
<br>
6.2 Alternator brushes: <br>
<br>
Alternator brushes are fed by the rotor wires. The brushes, made of<br>
pressed carbon, maintain electrical contact with the rotor while it<br>
is spinning. Removing the (left) cover of the alternator will allow<br>
you to examine the brushes. <br>
<br>
The brushes only carry the current needed to "excite" the moving<br>
magnetic field in the alternator (an amp or so.) The big output<br>
current of the alternator comes from the stator wires, and they have<br>
no moving parts. This is part of the reason the brushes last so long. <br>
<br>
The brushes are pretty hefty to start. The biggest concern, then, is<br>
not that they will wear out, but that the electrical characteristics<br>
of the brushes will change. The brush material can absorb oil<br>
(especially if you lay the bike on its left side!), and just "age" in<br>
general, becoming more resistive. As long as the bike's electrical<br>
system is capable of reaching the regulated voltage, there is no<br>
problem. <br>
<br>
6.3 Regulator box: <br>
<br>
The regulator box contains both the regulator and the rectifier. It<br>
is located on the left side of the bike, near the ignition. It has<br>
large heat-sink fins, and the internal circuitry is "potted" in<br>
epoxy. The most common problem is corrosion in the connector. The<br>
next most common problem is with rectifier diodes burning out. <br>
<br>
The unit is generally very reliable. You can verify proper operation<br>
by measuring the regulated voltage on the red wire with the battery<br>
fully charged and the bike running. You should also measure the<br>
voltage on the green wire as you rev the engine. This should start at<br>
1.8 Volts at idle and increases to about 10 or 11 Volts as rpms are<br>
increased. (See the manual excerpt for details.) <br>
<br>
6.4 Checking Diodes: <br>
<br>
There are six diodes in the rectifier. Since the entire circuit is<br>
embedded in epoxy, it is not possible to repair them. It is possible<br>
to check them, though. <br>
<br>
First, disconnect the regulator box from the wiring harness. Then,<br>
using a voltmeter with diode checking, check between each of the<br>
three white wires and the red output wire. For each white wire, you<br>
should "see" a diode pointing towards the red wire. Next, check each<br>
white wire against the black ground wire. This time, you will "see"<br>
diodes pointing from ground toward each of the three wires. <br>
If one of the diodes is fried, like an open circuit, it is possible,<br>
if you are crafty, to add a new diode externally. If any of them are<br>
short circuited, you'll need to replace the rectifier. <br>
<br>
7. Ignition: <br>
<br>
This bike uses a Transistor Controlled Ignition (TCI), not a<br>
Capacitive Discharge Ignition (CDI). TCI's are known to be finicky<br>
about supply voltage. (This is because the circuit requires a minimum<br>
voltage just to get all the transistors into their "operating"<br>
state). <br>
<br>
The TCI gets its ignition timing information from two pick-up coils<br>
on the left end of the crankshaft. The timing is not adjustable, and<br>
the TCI determines advance internally, based only upon rpm. There is<br>
no distributer, vacuum, or mechanical advance on this bike. Although<br>
the timing is not adjustable, you can verify the advance action with<br>
a timing light by removing the left crank shaft cover. <br>
<br>
The TCI box, located on the left side of the bike, under the side<br>
cover, does not have internally serviceable parts. The TCI circuits<br>
themselves are pretty reliable. The same cannot be said for the<br>
connectors on and inside of the box. If the red wire has the proper<br>
voltage, and the ignition is making a good spark, the TCI can be<br>
considered good. <br>
<br>
There have been reports of the TCI getting fried from improper<br>
jump-starting of the bike. Keeping the ignition turned "off" while<br>
connecting the jumper cables will probably prevent this problem. <br>
<br>
7.1 Coils: <br>
<br>
There are two ignition coils for the four cylinders. What this means<br>
is that each cylinder gets twice as many sparks as it needs, one<br>
during the compression stroke for ignition, and one during the<br>
exhaust stroke. The only reason for the extra spark is to simplify<br>
the ignition system and use two coils instead of four. This is<br>
possible because the one and four cylinders and the two and three<br>
cylinders move in synchrony (with different valve timing). This is<br>
important to remember if you ever connect a tach to the bike, 2000<br>
rpm will read like 4000 rpm. <br>
<br>
The coils are pretty reliable if the connections are good and there<br>
are no physical problems, like cracks, in the ignition wires or in<br>
the plastic case around the coils (which can cause high voltage<br>
leaks). <br>
<br>
You can check the secondary resistance of each coil by removing the<br>
plug-caps (they screw off) and measuring the resistance between the<br>
ends of the two plug wires. The specification is 11k Ohms. <br>
<br>
[Note: The manuals show measuring the secondary resistance with the<br>
plug caps on. This has been determined to be incorrect by the readers<br>
of the XJ Mailing list. Yes, Yamaha, Haynes, and Clymer all got it<br>
wrong.] <br>
<br>
A low resistance measurement indicates an internal short in the coil,<br>
and results in diminished spark. A high resistance measurement also<br>
diminishes spark somewhat. An open circuit between the plug wires<br>
means a wire is broken, either a plug wire or an internal coil wire. <br>
<br>
[A coil may still operate with an open circuit secondary. The voltage<br>
spike jumps the broken wire (another spark), in addition to sparking<br>
the two plugs. In some cases, its possible to ride for a number of<br>
years with an internal broken wire!] <br>
<br>
The plug-caps have been the source of problems for some XJ owners.<br>
They are resistor caps (designed to reduce radio interference.)<br>
Yamaha replacements are a bit expensive, but aftermarket ones from<br>
NGK are available and are said to work well. Typically, all four caps<br>
are replaced with NGK 5k Ohm caps. <br>
<br>
The coils have been called "weak" on occasion by members of the<br>
xj-owners group. To be clear, the coils aren't really weak, they just<br>
don't operate well if the supply voltage is low. (After market coils<br>
may help, but only slightly: They draw more current and will create a<br>
bigger voltage drop, see headlight section for an explanation.)<br>
Replacing the coils will not solve the underlying problem. <br>
<br>
Since both the coil and the TCI are responsible for making a good<br>
spark, reducing the voltage available to them amplifies any spark<br>
problem. Reducing the voltage to the coil reduces the spark directly,<br>
and reducing the voltage to the TCI hurts the spark further. This is<br>
why having a good voltage supply and ground to the ignition (meaning<br>
good, clean, uncorroded connectors) and a strong battery is essential<br>
to keeping the bike in good working order. (And so critical in these<br>
bikes.) <br>
<br>
8. Headlamps, lighting, and accessories: <br>
<br>
8.1 Upgrading: <br>
<br>
The most common question about headlights is, "Can I make them<br>
brighter?" The simple answer is yes, though actually making this<br>
happen can be quite involved. <br>
<br>
The alternator can withstand a bit of extra load. It is rated for 19<br>
amps, and uses about 12 or so in the stock configuration (depending<br>
on the bike). Adding two 100 watt driving lights is out of the<br>
question, but increasing the power of the existing lights is<br>
possible. <br>
<br>
The standard headlight (55/65 watt) draws from 3-6 amps depending on<br>
things like alternator voltage and resistive losses in the power<br>
path. A high power light (55/100 watt or 85/100 watt) will increase<br>
this draw by 3 or 4 amps. Judging from the uses of the power in the<br>
bike, and personal experience, the alternator can handle this. But<br>
that's not the end of the story. <br>
<br>
8.2 A good idea? <br>
<br>
Why is simply changing the headlight element to a high power<br>
headlight not necessarily a good idea? <br>
<br>
For one, you've got to consider the path the additional power must<br>
follow. The headlight current comes from the alternator and battery<br>
(which are connected together with the main fuse.) This power then<br>
goes to the keyswitch, and then back to the fuse block, where the<br>
power is split between the three remaining fuses (one being the<br>
headlight fuse). From the headlight fuse the power goes to a relay<br>
(which keeps the headlight from coming on until the bike is running),<br>
then it goes to the dimmer switch on the left handlebar. From there<br>
the power (now two wires, one for high, and one for low beam) goes to<br>
THE COMPUTER (for models that have them). <br>
<br>
What happens in the computer? The current goes onto the main circuit<br>
board where each wire (high and low beam) goes to a coil which is<br>
wrapped around a reed switch. When current is running through one of<br>
the coils, a magnetic field is induced which triggers the reed<br>
switch. The reed switch is connected to the computer, and allows the<br>
computer to know when a headlight is burnt out. If a headlight is<br>
out, no current will be in the coils and the reed switch won't<br>
trigger--the computer sets a warning "HEAD" and a flashing light. <br>
<br>
[If your bike does this, you can see it work by removing the<br>
headlight and starting the bike.] <br>
<br>
When the headlight current comes out of the coils, it leaves the<br>
computer and goes directly to the headlight via the headlight<br>
connector. <br>
<br>
8.3 Where might problems arise? <br>
<br>
1) Additional current through the headlight relay may cause the<br>
contacts to wear out too quickly or arcweld themselves. <br>
<br>
2) Extra current through the headlight dimmer switch may also be<br>
beyond the designed amperage rating, causing the switch to fail. <br>
<br>
3) Those little coils inside the computer: They might fry. They might<br>
also short and fry the computer. They might fry the traces on the<br>
circuit board. (Not all models) <br>
<br>
4) Resistive voltage drops increase: Since the wire that goes through<br>
the keyswitch shares the current for the headlight, ign, alternator<br>
rotor, computer, other lights, (everything!), drawing extra current<br>
down it will drop the voltage available to everything else. This can<br>
cause a number of complicated problems, including battery<br>
overcharging. You would have to be VERY careful to have good, clean,<br>
connections down this path. Even 1/2 ohm of resistance will cause a<br>
problem. <br>
<br>
5) Can the wiring handle it? (Yes, I believe so, although making sure<br>
you don't have corroded wires will be more important than ever.) <br>
<br>
Why doesn't plugging in an high power headlight element seem to add<br>
much light? <br>
<br>
It has to do with above issue number four, resistive voltage drops.<br>
When you plug in a high power headlight, what you are doing is<br>
increasing the current along the power path. Any resistance along<br>
this path will drop the voltage available to the headlight. <br>
<br>
Simple answer: Put in a higher power headlight, but drop the voltage<br>
available to it, and you end up with the same light output (or only<br>
slightly better) than you started with. <br>
<br>
Technical answer: A 55 watt light operating at 12 v (nom.) will draw<br>
about 4.5 amps. A 100 watt draws 8 amps. If there is 1/2 ohm<br>
resistance in the supply, the 55 watt lamp will lose about 2 volts.<br>
The 55 watt bulb, with 10 volts will put out only about 35 watts<br>
worth of light. For the 100 watt bulb, the voltage drop is more like<br>
4 volts. A 100 watt bulb operating at 8 volts will put out about 45<br>
watts worth of light. Which is not much better than what you started<br>
with. <br>
<br>
[I am ignoring the nonlinear characteristics of incandescent lighting<br>
like inrush current and variable resistance due to self- heating, but<br>
you get the idea. Comes from P=I^2*R, where power is proportional to<br>
the square of the current...] <br>
<br>
8.4 Recommendations: <br>
<br>
If you really want more light, run a separate wire from the<br>
alternator output (at the rectifier). This will reduce resistive<br>
losses, and give you a brighter light. Once you have full power<br>
coming out of your 85/100 watt light, you will need to take into<br>
consideration the other problems, melting reflectors, burning out<br>
switches etc. And if you have the computer in your bike all the<br>
things I mentioned earlier become important. <br>
<br>
8.5 Suggestion: <br>
<br>
Car people do this all the time: Install separate relays for the high<br>
power headlight, with its own power feed directly from the alternator<br>
(put a fuse in, please!). You'll need two relays, one for high and<br>
one for low. <br>
<br>
Problem (Only models with computer): If you do this, you will no<br>
longer be drawing a substantial current through the computer's coil<br>
sensor thingy. This will trigger your "HEAD" message and flashing<br>
light. You will need to disable it. This can be done by opening your<br>
computer and doing magic, which I don't suggest, unless you REALLY<br>
know what you're doing. Or, you can simply remove the bulb under the<br>
flashing "warning" light and ignore the dashboard. <br>
<br>
8.6 The little Driving light (Models that have it): <br>
<br>
If your bike has one of those little driving lights under the main<br>
headlight, there is something you can do to easily soup it up. The<br>
OEM lamp is 35 watts. The bulb mount is identical to those off-road<br>
driving lights made by Hella (expensive) and Ralley-X (cheap) found<br>
in automotive stores. You can replace the bulb with a 55 watt version<br>
(<$10).  I've been doing this for years.  The extra current (20 <br>
watts) is within the wiring and switches capabilities.  Don't use<br>
the 100 watt version, though, it may melt things.<br>
<br>
[One owner reported trying the 100 watt light. He found the<br>
illumination pattern is drastically different from stock and<br>
practically useless.] <br>
<br>
This little driving light does not go through the computer, but all<br>
the other caveats apply. <br>
<br>
8.7 Headlight Relay: <br>
<br>
It seems not all XJ bikes have this. For those that do, the headlight<br>
relay keeps the headlight from turning on until the bike is running.<br>
It is also possible that this option has been bypassed after a relay<br>
failure by a previous owner of your bike. <br>
<br>
The headlight relay is connected to one of the output wires on the<br>
alternator (via its own diode), and is configured as a "latch". What<br>
this means is that the headlight doesn't come on until the alternator<br>
is spinning fast enough to set the relay, and then it holds itself<br>
"on" until the ignition switch is turned off. <br>
<br>
Often, the headlight will come on during cranking even if the engine<br>
doesn't start. This just indicates that the alternator was moving<br>
enough to latch the relay. This is normal. Simply turn the ignition<br>
switch to "off" then "on" to reset the relay. <br>
<br>
This setup prevents the headlight from drawing current while the<br>
starter is spinning, trying to get the ignition to fire up. It helps<br>
keep the battery voltage up during cranking, and compensates somewhat<br>
for the "weak coil" problem I mentioned earlier. <br>
<br>
9. Computer monitor system (Not all models): <br>
<br>
The computer monitor system on the Secas performs a number of<br>
functions. It is not, however, as sophisticated as automobile<br>
computers, which control fuel mixture and shift patterns. <br>
<br>
What it does do: <br>
<br>
The computer monitors seven things: <br>
<br>
 1) The position of the side stand.<br>
 2) Brake fluid level in the master cylinder<br>
 3) Battery electrolyte level (See above)<br>
 4) Engine oil level<br>
 5) Headlamps<br>
 6) Taillights<br>
 7) Fuel level (gauge)<br>
 <br>
The computer is just a monitor. That is to say, it takes inputs but<br>
actually controls nothing. It contains what is probably a<br>
microprocessor and circuits to convert the inputs into digital<br>
signals. The only "outside" signals that pass through the computer<br>
are the headlight and taillight currents. <br>
<br>
The monitor system is very reliable, and the only concern is that<br>
some of the connectors might get corroded. The dashboard "Warning<br>
Control" and "Check" buttons are extremely reliable as they use<br>
sealed reed switches and magnets to connect to the computer. <br>
<br>
10. Canceling turn signal: <br>
<br>
The self-canceling turn signal works off of a reed switch in the<br>
speedometer. It is generally reliable, although problems have been<br>
frequently seen in the turn signal switch itself. <br>
<br>
If you experience problems with getting the turn signals to engage,<br>
disassemble and clean the switch. <br>
<br>
When one of the turn signal bulbs is burnt out, the signal will not<br>
flash. This is characteristic of the design, and is helpful to alert<br>
you to a bad bulb. Reduced voltage from connector corrosion can cause<br>
the same effect, as can a dying turn signal relay. <br>
<br>
11. Overcharging: (You've heard so much about it!) [Top] <br>
<br>
It seems counter-intuitive, but one of the most common electrical<br>
problems with this bike is battery OVER-charging due to corroded<br>
connectors. This really does happen. Here's why: <br>
<br>
The first thing to examine is how the alternator and voltage<br>
regulator work. As mentioned earlier, the bike uses what is called a<br>
regulated alternator. The regulator "measures" the voltage in the<br>
bike's wiring harness and "programs" the alternator to make enough<br>
power to keep the voltage at the right level. It is a very simple<br>
"feedback" loop. <br>
<br>
This is a great setup, the regulation is simple, and because the<br>
output of the alternator is variable, wastes less energy, and puts<br>
less drag on the engine at high rpm's. (more HP's!) It also saves the<br>
expense of really big transistors and heat sinks to regulate the full<br>
19 amp output of the alternator. <br>
<br>
The implementation, however, has a problem. Yamaha engineers chose to<br>
measure the regulated voltage after the key switch, about five feet<br>
of wire and seven or so connectors away from the alternator output.<br>
<br>
(This is necessary so that the measuring circuit and rotor coil will<br>
not draw power from the battery when the bike is off.) <br>
<br>
But, there are those seven connectors and all that wire. This is an<br>
invitation for an inaccurate measurement. This is due to resistance<br>
along the path. <br>
<br>
How much does this matter? Well, since the motorcycle (neglecting the<br>
battery) draws between 5 and 10 amps down this wire to power things<br>
like the headlights, ignition, etc., a total resistance in this path<br>
of only 1/2 ohm will make the alternator output RISE between 2.5 and<br>
5 volts to compensate. This is bad. <br>
<br>
There are two reasons this is bad. In the 1/2 ohm example, the<br>
alternator is making 12.5 to 50 watts of power more than the bike<br>
needs. Where does this power go? Let's say that one of the connectors<br>
is introducing 1/2 ohm of resistance due to corrosion. The connector<br>
will heat up. It might even melt. Could be a serious problem. And<br>
often is. Even if it doesn't melt, you just lost about 1/10 of a<br>
horsepower. <br>
<br>
The second, and more important, reason this is bad: <br>
<br>
11.1 Batteries Boiling (or how Yamaha keeps Yuasa in business..)<br>
 <br>
The battery is connected much closer to the output of the alternator.<br>
In fact, it is connected directly to the red wire of the output<br>
through the main fuse. When the alternator output rises by 2.5 to 5<br>
volts as in the above example, the battery will now be "seeing" a<br>
full 17 to 19.5 volts (14.5 + 2.5 or 5)!! This WILL overcharge your<br>
battery. In the least severe case, you will be constantly be adding<br>
distilled water and replacing your battery every other year. In the<br>
most severe case, the battery will die a quick death with distended<br>
sides and your mechanic claiming, "But the regulator tested fine..." <br>
<br>
11.2 Solutions: <br>
<br>
Yamaha's design is sound as long as the resistance in the loop is low<br>
enough. When the bike comes from the factory, there is no corrosion<br>
in the connectors. The internal resistance of the wires is very small<br>
(I would guess less than 0.05 ohm total), resulting in a very small<br>
difference between the brown and red wires (about 0.25 volts). This<br>
difference will not boil batteries. <br>
<br>
The solution is simple: Don't let connectors get corroded. Fix or<br>
replace connectors that are. <br>
<br>
12. Corrosion, Connectors, and Rants: <br>
<br>
12.1 Fixing corroded connectors: <br>
<br>
Vehicle manufacturers have only recently seemed to get there acts<br>
together as far as proper electrical connections are concerned. The<br>
key is to keep air away from the metal. The best way is to<br>
butt-splice two wires together, solder, spray with "High-tack" or<br>
some other sealant, and cover with heat-shrink tubing. It will never<br>
corrode. <br>
<br>
["High-tack" is a sticky red spray that mechanics use to hold gaskets<br>
in place while installing them. Its thick and sticky nature keeps air<br>
away from the metal making it great for this application. It's an<br>
insulator, and doesn't ever really dry. It can be found in any auto<br>
parts store. (This stuff is also great to spray on battery terminals<br>
after they are connected...)] <br>
<br>
12.2 The next best way: <br>
<br>
Not all connections should be made permanent. Use the best connectors<br>
you can find. You can fill the backs of the connectors with silicone<br>
caulk, or silicone dielectric grease to keep as much air out as<br>
possible, or use big heat shrink tubing, or tight electrical tape to<br>
make the connectors last longer. Do it properly now and you won't be<br>
re-doing it in two years. Crimp AND SOLDER if possible. <br>
<br>
12.3 CORRODED CONNECTORS DON'T ALWAYS LOOK CORRODED: <br>
<br>
There are a couple of ways to track down corroded connectors. Of<br>
course, you can just pull them apart and look at them, but this<br>
doesn't always work. It doesn't take much to make 1/4 ohm of<br>
resistance with corrosion. Often you can't see the corrosion, or the<br>
offending oxide is lurking between the crimp of the connector and the<br>
strands of the wire. Or even surface oxidation, which slightly<br>
changes the color of the metal could be enough to make problems. <br>
<br>
Remember what I said about connectors getting hot and melting? Well,<br>
feel them while the bike is running. They shouldn't even be warm, you<br>
may not be able to tell with your fingers, so press them against your<br>
cheek. Seriously, this works great on connectors carrying large<br>
currents. (like the ones I am complaining about.) Don't electrocute<br>
yourself. <br>
<br>
You can measure the VOLTAGE drop across the connector with a<br>
voltmeter while the bike is operating. Don't stick the probes<br>
directly into the connector, though, because sometimes the corrosion<br>
is between the crimp and the wire. Find where the wire comes from and<br>
goes to, and measure from there. Rule of thumb --a volt or two drop<br>
(on a 12V system) is bad. <br>
<br>
[Note: Measuring the RESISTANCE across connectors is NOT a good way<br>
to identify corrosion problems. In many cases, the resistance is too<br>
low for a meter to accurately measure (less than 1 ohm), but can<br>
still cause a problem. Also, a multimeter uses a very small current<br>
to measure resistance. Many of the connectors carry large currents.<br>
The actual resistance of the connector at its normal operating<br>
current can be different, due to self heating and other effects.] <br>
<br>
You can even accomplish a lot with a little sandpaper or emery board.<br>
Beware, however, of removing plating from connectors, often the base<br>
metal will corrode quicker than the plating did... <br>
<br>
[An industrial contact cleaner called Cramolin (now called DeOxit)<br>
has been suggested for yearly connector maintenance. Although it is<br>
very good, it is expensive and difficult to obtain for lay-people.<br>
Avionics technicians often use it, so you might be able to get it<br>
from your local airplane mechanic. Diluted versions are sometimes<br>
available in electronics supply stores, some of which aren't worth<br>
spit. WD-40 is a fair alternative, as are some products by CRC.] <br>
<br>
12.4 Where do I start? <br>
<br>
For the overcharging problem, the critical connections are: <br>
<br>
 - the brown wire at the voltage regulator<br>
 - the brown and red wires on the ignition switch connector behind<br>
the headlight.<br>
 - the red and black wires on the voltage regulator<br>
 <br>
You really should check every connector on the bike, because there<br>
are other things that can go wrong. For example, weak spark from<br>
corrosion in the ignition supply line (engine stop switch, relays,<br>
etc.,) can cause the ignition to cut out intermittently. It is also<br>
important to check all wires that carry large currents, like the wire<br>
to and from the battery, battery connections, solenoid, starter, etc. <br>
<br>
12.5 Editorial comment on connectors: <br>
<br>
Electrical connections are often poorly done. Especially by<br>
mechanics. You can save yourself a lot of heartache and money by<br>
suspecting connections FIRST. It is very common for a motorcycle shop<br>
to unwittingly (or otherwise) install a brand new part, complete with<br>
new, uncorroded connectors, so solve what is really just a connector<br>
problem. <br>
<br>
In my earlier example, the overcharging problem, replacing the<br>
ignition switch and the voltage regulator would likely have<br>
introduced enough new, uncorroded connectors to solve, or reduce,<br>
battery overcharging. This will cost you quite a bit more than simply<br>
fixing the connectors yourself. <br>
<br>
Engineers design their "little boxes" very well in general. There are<br>
all sort of neat things that you don't hear about like current<br>
limiters and thermal shutdown circuits designed into voltage<br>
regulators and electronic ignitions that make them very reliable.<br>
Please don't insult these guys by assuming they are broken just<br>
because a Yamaha accountant didn't think good connectors were cost<br>
effective. <br>
