<br>
<br>
<br>
Motorcycle batteries have one thing in common, they are all too small. Even the <br>
biggest ones are too small for what they have to do. These days, it seems as <br>
though nobody believes in kickstarters anymore, so a well taken care of battery <br>
is doubly important. <br>
A battery will loose 1% of its charge per day just sitting there doing nothing. <br>
So you can see that you just can't park it, walk away, and come back in 4 or 5 <br>
months and expect it to work. Amazingly some of them do work after that kind of <br>
abuse, but a greater number of them don't. The cure? Trickle charge the battery <br>
at least once a month.<br>
If you don't, it's OK, I don't care. It's not my Battery!!!<br>
I have found that it is best to use a 1 Amp or smaller trickle charger. Most <br>
motorcycle batteries are small and just can't take the high rate of charge that <br>
a 6 or 10 Amp charger gives. A general rule of thumb is that a battery should <br>
not be charged at more than 1/20 its rated capacity. As you can see, even a big <br>
motorcycle battery is maxed out by a 2 Amp charger. The battery should be <br>
charged till it is gassing (bubbling) freely, but then stop, don't boil all your <br>
water out! The temperature of a battery must not go over 112 degrees. If it <br>
does, the battery may be ruined. If the electrolite is below the plates add <br>
distilled water till the plates are covered and/or to the top of the fill line. <br>
Always unplug the charger before removing the leads from the battery and keep <br>
the battery away from flames and sparks. Remember all that gassing in the <br>
battery is producing Oxyhydrogen Gas. This can and will EXPLODE the battery, <br>
covering you with acid which will burn you like you will not believe. Baking <br>
soda will neutralize battery acid and water will rinse it off and dilute it. <br>
Mixing baking soda and water together works great. You can use it anywhere on <br>
the bike or yourself to remove battery acid. Keep lots of both on hand.<br>
If You Don't, It's OK, I Don't Care. It's Not My BODY!!!<br>
If a battery is totally discharged, and you goof and connect the plus and minus <br>
leads backwards you can change the polarity of the battery. Plus is minus, minus <br>
is plus. I had a customer who did that. That was a fun one till I figured it <br>
out. I just drained the battery to zip, recharged it the right way... worked <br>
just fine... go figure.<br>
Here is a trick that works maybe 60-70 % of the time...You have a battery that <br>
is almost junk, will not hold a charge. Put some Epsom salt, maybe 1/4 teaspoon, <br>
in each cell. Sometimes, not always, it will keep it going another 2-3 months. <br>
Won't hurt anything... the batterys junk anyway, but it might get you through <br>
till winter!<br>
It's a funny thing, you can have a battery that reads 12.5 volts on a volt <br>
meter, but still will not light a small light bulb. Volts only tell you part of <br>
the story. The acid in the battery must be good. The Specific Gravity must be <br>
around 1.26 to 1.28 (in a fully charged battery) and you measure this with a <br>
hydrometer. The only trouble is this... there just isn't enough fluid in most <br>
motorcycle battery's to test with a big auto hydrometer. You must use one of the <br>
cheapy, small, 5 ball, pencil types. Oh well, at least they work and between the <br>
two you will have the whole story.<br>
