<h2>Dyna Coils on an XJ700N/NC/S/SC (non-X)</h2>

This is how I went about putting Dyna brand ignition coils on my XJ700.
They're not the same size/shape as the stock coils, nor do they mount
the same way.  Also, the XJ700N/NC/S/SC (non-X) motorcycles seem to
mount the IG coils different from any other XJ.<p>

This project used a set of Dyna coils (DC1-1, 3 ohm, dual angled
outputs) and Dyna 8mm Suppression spark plug wires (DW800) that I ordered
from Motorcycle Accessory Warehouse, some aluminum angle stock (1in x
1in x 1/8in thick), and a handful of 6mm bolts(4 longer, 4 shorter, I
forgot the exact lengths), washers(4 flat washers), lock washers(8)
and nuts(4).  <p>

The stock coils before beginning.  They mount onto the frame between the
tank and the steering head.  They're each covered with a chromed plastic
cover.

The stock coils with the covers off.  Judging by the OEM part numbers,
these are different coils than those mounted stock on other XJs.  Note
that the plastic cover is held on by phillips head bolts that go into
the top of the funny bolts that hold the coils on.
</td></tr>

This shows the mount points with the coils removed.  They accept M6
metric bolts.  Note that the clutch and choke cables pass between the
coil and the frame.  The throttle cable does the same on the other
side.

<a href="photo_07.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_07.jpg"></a></td><td>
These show the difference in size and mounting between the stock coils
and the Dynas as well as the chrome plastic cover.  You should note the
following:
<ul>
<li>The Dyna coil mounting holes are at right angles to the stock ones.</li>
<li>The mounting holes on the Dyna don't line up with the originals.</li>
<li>The Dyna is close to the same length, but fatter.</li>
<li>The plastic cover won't fit over the Dyna--especially the
plug wire terminals on the side.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="photo_08.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_08.jpg"></a></td><td>
So, I need to turn the mount points 90&deg and move them a little ways.  I
had originally gone looking for a piece of channel of some kind that
would have a U shape, but couldn't find anything that was both big
enough to find around the Dyna coil posts and small enough to fit.  I
settled on a right angled piece of aluminum instead.  <br>
I cut four pieces about 22mm long.  (If you're following along,
don't do that now, read the whole thing first.)  After every cut and
every hole drilled, I used emery cloth to clean up the edges.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="photo_09.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_09.jpg"></a>

<a href="photo_11.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_11.jpg"></a>
<a href="photo_12.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_12.jpg"></a></td><td>
Then I drilled 1/4in holes in one side.  I tried to center them
between the inside of angle and the back edge and place them within
3-4mm of the edge.  The coils only just fit betwen the posts alone.  As
you can see, when the coils are set in, there's little clearance.  The
outside corner of the upper one in particular is too close for comfort.
Probably caused by my complete inability to cut a straight line with a
hack saw.  Note throttle cable as mentioned before.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="photo_13.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_13.jpg"></a>
<a href="photo_14.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_14.jpg"></a><br>
<a href="photo_15.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_15.jpg"></a></td><td>
As you can see here, I trimmed that corner off.  I was very glad of that
later as it would have been almost impossible to get them in with the
primary wires on without that little bit of extra room.  I also have the
tank set back on and the bars hard over to check for clearance.  The
forks come within 1/2in, but don't touch and the tank clears fine.</td></tr>

Here's some shots of how the brackets look before getting drilled for
the coil mounting holes.

<a href="photo_20.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_20.jpg"></a></td><td>
For the metal working ignorant (which includes me, unfortunately) I
drilled the holes using metal working twist bits.  I marked the holes by
setting the coils on, holding them so that they were off of both
brackets, and scratched around through the mounting hole with a nail.  I
then used the nail to make a dimple in the center of the mark.  I used a
smaller bit to drill a pilot hole and then a 1/4in bit for the final
hole.  If I'd had a drill press, I would have used it.  I don't have
any pictures of all that because I only have two hands. :-)<p>
In these shots you can see the hole marking, the pilot and then the
finished brackets.

<tr><td><a href="photo_21.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_21.jpg"></a>
<a href="photo_22.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_22.jpg"></a></td><td>
Here you can see that the stock coils have the primary (input) wires
soldered on.  I clipped them off (leaving enough on the stock coil to
reattach, just in case) and crimped/soldered on the eye terms that came
with the Dynas.  Note that the yellow and white connectors indicate left
and right sides respectively.  The Dynas don't care which coil goes on which
side nor which wire goes on which terminal.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="photo_23.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_23.jpg"></a></td><td>
Here you can see the fully mounted coil.  These terminals are awfully
close to the mounting bolt, aren't they?
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="photo_24.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_24.jpg"></a>
<a href="photo_25.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_25.jpg"></a></td><td>
I'd never messed with spark plug wires before, so I was a bit confused
when I stripped it.  That black core is the conductor.  The wire itself
provides the RF impeding resistance that the NGK resistor cap did
before.  The instructions are clear enough once you know that that is
the conductor.  Be careful crimping on that connector, the wire slides
out of it easily if you put silicone on as they recommend for the boot
and don't crimp it hard enough.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="photo_26.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_26.jpg"></a></td><td>
And here it is running with the Dynas on!  First time I started it this
season.  As you can see, it's gotten rather dark and I didn't go for a
ride that night.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="photo_27.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_27.jpg"></a>
<a href="photo_28.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_28.jpg"></a></td><td>
The more I thought about it, the more that narrow gap between the coil
primary terminals and the bracket worried me.  So the next day I made
new versions of the bottom brackets that used the lower of the two holes
in the coil post.  You can see that there's loads more clearance that
way.<br> The spark plug wires are much closer to the tank now than with
stock, but since most motorcycles mount the coils right up under the
tank anyway, I figured that was fine.  I can always pull them away with
zip ties if needed.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="photo_29.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_29.jpg"></a>
<a href="photo_30.jpg"><img src="thumbnail_30.jpg"></a></td><td>
Finished product warming up to ride (luverly snow, isn't it?) and here's
me about to go for the first XJ ride of the year.  I'll probably return
to this project later and either carve up the chrome covers to fit over
the coils or just paint them black.  I think the green kind of stands
out.  And, for the record, I'm not nearly as fat as that picture makes
me out to be.  :-)
