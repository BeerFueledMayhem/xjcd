<p>In attendance (with bikes) from left to right: David Kuehner (Seca 650 
Turbo), Bob Gibbs (XJ 750), Dwayne Verhey (Seca 750), Matt Foster (Seca 650), 
Lorne Jackman (Seca 650) and Ross Presta (Maxim 650)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon to get together and work on the bikes. 
Ross and Dwayne brought colour tune plugs and carb balancers. I was first to 
tune my 82 650 Seca and with a few tries (and a few backfires) was able adjust 
the carbs and get my bike running well. Matt noticed a huge difference in his 
Seca after tuning his carbs.</p>

<p>David's turbo may still need some tweaking as it's fuel system is a little 
different.</p>

<p>After and afternoon of carb tuning Matt, David and Bob had other obligations. 
Ross, Dwayne and I went for a ride on some of
<a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/elhum/">Ontario's Great Bike Roads</a>. First 
was the ride in to Brampton via
<a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/elhum/creditvw.htm">Creditview Road.</a> To
<a href="http://www.hooters.com">Hooters</a> on Queens St. in Brampton. Then on 
to one of the best bike roads at
<a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/elhum/forks.htm">The Fork of The Credit</a></p>

<p>On our ride thru the Forks fo the Credit we passed a Kawasaki Ninja that had 
some misfortune. We later met up with the rider Mike at the town of Belfountain 
and He told us how he dropped his bike out on his first ride of the year. We 
dropped Mike off at home at met his wife and took his suggestion to go eat at 
Harp's pub in Port Credit.</p>
